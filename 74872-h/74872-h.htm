<H3><I><A id="OurLives">OUR LIVES</A></I></H3>
<P>Our lives are songs.&nbsp;God writes the words, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And we set them to music at pleasure; 
<BR>And the song grows glad, or sweet, or sad, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As we choose to fashion the measure. 
<P>We must write the music, whatever the song, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever its rhyme, or metre; 
<BR>And if it is sad, we can make it glad. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or if sweet, we can make it sweeter. 
<P>One has a song that is free and strong; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But the music he writes is minor; 
<BR>And the sad, sad strain is replete with pain, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the singer becomes a repiner. 
<P>And he thinks God gave him a dirge-like lay. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor knows that the words are cheery; 
<BR>And the song seems lonely and solemn--only 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the music is dreary. 
<P>And the song of another has through the words 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;An under current of sadness; 
<BR>But he sets it to music of ringing chords, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes it a pean of gladness. 
<P>So, whether our songs are sad or not, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We can give the world more pleasure. 
<BR>And better ourselves, by setting the words 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To a glad, triumphant measure. 
<H3><I><A id="Messenger">THE MESSENGER</A></I></H3>
<P>She rose up, in the early dawn, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And white, and silently she moved 
<BR>About the house:&nbsp;Four men had gone 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To battle for the land they loved: 
<BR>And she, the mother, and the wife. 
<BR>Waited for tidings from the strife. 
<BR>How still the house seemed; and her tread 
<BR>Sounded like footsteps of the dead. 
<P>The long day passed.&nbsp;The dark night came. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She had not seen a human face. 
<BR>Some voice spoke suddenly her name. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;How loud it sounded in that place 
<BR>Where, day on day, no sound was heard 
<BR>But her own footsteps.&nbsp;&quot;Bring you word,&quot;
<BR>She cried, to whom she could not see--
<BR>&quot;Word from the battle plain to me?&quot; 
<BR>A soldier entered at the door, 
<BR>And stood within the dim firelight. 
<P>&quot;I bring you tidings of the four&quot; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, &quot;Who left you for the fight.&quot; 
<BR>&quot;God bless you friend!&quot; she cried, &quot;speak on!&quot; 
<BR>For I can bear it.&nbsp;&quot;One is gone?&quot; 
<BR>&quot;Ay! one is gone!&quot; he said, &quot;Which one?&quot; 
<BR>&quot;Dear lady--he, your eldest son.&quot; 
<P>A deathly pallor shot across 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her withered face: she did not weep. 
<BR>She said, &quot;It is a grievous loss, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But God gives his beloved sleep. 
<BR>What of the living--of the three, 
<BR>And when can they come back to me?&quot; 
<BR>The soldier turned away his head, 
<BR>&quot;Lady, your husband too, is dead.&quot; 
<P>She put her hand upon her brow. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A wild, sharp pain, was in her eyes, 
<BR>&quot;My husband? oh God help me now.&quot; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier shivered at her sighs. 
<BR>The task was harder than he thought. 
<BR>&quot;Your youngest son, dear madam, fought 
<BR>Close at his father's side: both fell 
<BR>Dead, by the bursting of a shell.&quot; 
<P>She moved her lips and seemed to moan. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her face had paled to ashen grey--
<BR>&quot;Then one is left me--one alone,&quot; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, &quot;of four who marched away. 
<BR>Oh, Over-ruling, All-wise God, 
<BR>How can I pass beneath Thy rod!&quot; 
<BR>The soldier walked across the floor. 
<BR>Paused at the window, at the door--
<P>Wiped the cold dew drops from his cheek 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And sought the mourner's side again. 
<BR>&quot;Once more, dear lady, I must speak. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your last remaining son was slain 
<BR>Just at the closing of the fight, 
<BR>'Twas he who sent me here to-night.&quot; 
<BR>&quot;God knows,&quot; the man said afterward, 
<BR>&quot;The fight itself, was not as hard.&quot; 
<P class="centered">1871</p>
<H3><I><A id="Idle">IDLE</A></I></H3>
<P>I sit in the twilight dim, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the close of an idle day, 
<BR>And list to the sweet, soft hymn 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That rises far away 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dies on the evening air. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, all day long they sing their song 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who toil in the valley there. 
<P>But never a song sing I, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting with folded hands. 
<BR>The hours pass me by, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropping their golden sands. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I list from day to day 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the tick, tick, tock, of the old brown clock 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ticking my life away. 
<P>And I see the sunlight fade, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I see the night come on; 
<BR>And then, in the gloom and shade, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I weep for the day that is gone. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weep, and wail, in pain, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the misspent day that has flown away 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And will not come again. 
<P>Another morning beams, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But I forget the last, 
<BR>And sit in my idle dreams 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the day is overpast. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the toiler's heart is glad 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the day is gone and the night comes on, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mine is sore, and sad. 
<P>For I dare not look behind: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No shining, golden sheaves 
<BR>Can I ever hope to find--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but withered leaves. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! dreams are very sweet! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But will it please if only these
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lay at the Master's feet. 
<P>And what will the Master say, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To dreams and nothing more? 
<BR>Oh, idler all the day! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Think, ere thy life is o'er! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the day grows late, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, soul of sin, will He let you in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There at the pearly gate? 
<P>Oh, idle heart beware! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On, to the field of strife! 
<BR>On to the valley there, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And live a useful life. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up! do not wait a day, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the old brown clock, with its tick, tick, tock, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is ticking your life away. 
<P class="centered">1869 
<H3><I><A id="YeAgents">YE AGENTS</A></I></H3>
<P>These agent men! these agent men! 
<BR>We hear the dreaded step again, 
<BR>We see a stranger at the door; 
<BR>And brace ourselves for war once more. 
<BR>He bows and smiles. &quot;Walk in,&quot; we say, 
<P>He smiles again. &quot;I come to-day. 
<BR>Dear Madam, with a great invention; 
<BR>And Sir, pray give me <i>your</i> attention; 
<BR>Now here, you see, is something new. 
<BR>And just the thing, my friends, for you.&quot; 
<P>In vain we interrupt and say: 
<BR>&quot;We shall not buy of you to-day.&quot; 
<BR>&quot;But, Madam, Sir, you have not seen 
<BR>The beauties of this new machine; 
<BR>When thus arranged, your old affair, 
<BR>'Tis plain to see, is just nowhere.&quot; 
<BR>&quot;No doubt,&quot; I say; &quot;'Tis very fine, 
<BR>And quite superior to mine.&quot; 
<BR>This gives him courage. On he goes, 
<BR>And every sentence glibly flows, 
<BR>Until his lesson is repeated 
<BR>To &quot;warranted if fitly treated.&quot; 
<P>&quot;Yes, new and fine, and grand,&quot; we say, 
<BR>&quot;But still, we shall not buy to-day.&quot; 
<BR>&quot;But, Madam, Sir, pray list to reason, 
<BR>'Twill buy itself in half a season; 
<BR>You see the thing is bound to go.&quot; 
<BR>&quot;Oh, certainly, we see, we know. 
<BR>But still, we do not wish to buy.&quot; 
<BR>He turns and leaves as with a sigh. 
<BR>And while we hasten to our labor 
<BR>He goes and persecutes our neighbor. 
<P>But lo! another follows on, 
<BR>Before the last is fairly gone. 
<BR>One day a reaper, next a mower, 
<BR>And then a fanning mill, and sower; 
<BR>Machines of all kinds 'neath the sun, 
<BR>Each better than the other one; 
<BR>A rocker for each dining chair, 
<BR>A brace to hold the broom in air, 
<BR>A book, just out, and you must buy 
<BR>Or give a proper reason why. 
<P>So, if we sometimes turn away 
<BR>Abruptly, Sirs, you must remember, 
<BR>That we have heard your tale each day 
<BR>From early Spring to late December. 
<BR>Why! if we listened to you all, 
<BR>And gave you the required attention, 
<BR>I think ere long each one would call, 
<BR>The &quot;county house,&quot; the <i>best</i> invention. 
<P class="centered">1869

<P>They stood at the garden gate. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;By the lifting of a lid 
<BR>She might have read her fate 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a little thing he did. 
<P>He plucked a beautiful flower, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tore it away from its place 
<BR>On the side of the blooming bower, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And held it against his face. 
<P>Drank in its beauty and bloom, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of his idle talk; 
<BR>Then cast it down to the gloom 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And dust of the garden walk. 
<P>Ay, trod it under his foot, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As it lay in his pathway there; 
<BR>Then spurned it away with his boot, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it had ceased to be fair. 
<P>Ah! the maiden might have read 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The doom of her young life then; 
<BR>But she looked in his eyes instead, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought him the king of men. 
<P>She looked in his eyes and blushed, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She hid in his strong arms' fold; 
<BR>And the tale of the flower, crushed 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And spurned, was once more told. 
<P>
<H3><I><A id="Life">LIFE</A></I></H3>
<P>An infant wailing in nameless fear; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow, perchance, in the quiet room, 
<BR>Or the hum of an insect flying near, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the screech-owl's cry, in the outer gloom. 
<P>A little child on the sun-checked floor, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A broken toy, and a tear-stained face, 
<BR>A young life clouded, a young heart sore; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the great clock, time, ticks on apace. 
<P>A maiden weeping in bitter pain, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Two white hands clasped on an aching brow. 
<BR>A blighted faith and a fond hope slain, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A shattered trust and a broken vow. 
<P>A matron holding a baby's shoe, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot tears gather, and fall at will 
<BR>On the knotted ribbon of white and blue, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the foot that wore it is cold and still. 
<P>An aged woman upon her bed, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Worn, and wearied, and poor and old, 
<BR>Longing to rest with the happy dead. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus the story of life is told. 
<P>Where is the season of careless glee? 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the moment that holds no pain? 
<BR>Life has its crosses from infancy 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to the grave; and its hopes are vain. 
<P class="centered">1870
<H3><I><A id="Stars">STARS</A></I></H3>
<P>Astronomers may gaze the heavens o'er, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Discovering wonders, great, perhaps, and true! 
<BR>That stars are worlds, and peopled like our own, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But I shall never think as these men do. 
<P>I shall believe them little shining things, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashioned from heavenly ore, and filled with light. 
<BR>And to the sky above, so smoothly blue, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;An angel comes and nails them, every night. 
<P>And I have seen him. You no doubt would think 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A white cloud, sailed across the heavens blue. 
<BR>But as I watched the feathery thing, it was 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;An angel nailing up the stars I knew. 
<P>And all night long they shine for us below; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shine in pale splendor, till the mighty sun 
<BR>Wakes up again. And then the angel comes, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And gathers in his treasures, one by one. 
<P>How sweet the task! Oh, when this life is done, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have joined the angel band on high, 
<BR>Of all that throng, oh may it be my lot. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To nail the stars upon the evening sky. 
<P class="centered">1868 
<H3><I><A id="Fading">FADING</A></I></H3>
<P>She sits beside the window. All who pass 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn once again to gaze on her sweet face. 
<BR>She is so fair; but soon, too soon, alas, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To lie down in her last low resting place. 
<P>No gems are brighter than her sparkling eyes. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her brow like polished marble, white and fair--
<BR>Her cheeks as glowing as the sunset skies--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;You would not dream that death was lurking there. 
<P>But, oh! he lingers closely at her side. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the forest dons its Autumn dress, 
<BR>We know that he will claim her as his bride, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And earth will number one fair spirit less. 
<P>She sees the meadow robed in richest green--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughing stream--the willows bending o'er. 
<BR>With tear dimmed eyes she views each sylvan scene, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And thinks earth never was so fair before. 
<P>We do not sigh for Heaven, till we have known, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Something of sorrow, something of grief and woe, 
<BR>And as a summer day her life has flown. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, can we wonder she is loath to go? 
<P>She has no friends in Heaven: all are here. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No lost one waits her in that unknown land, 
<BR>And life grows doubly, trebly sweet and dear, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As day by day, she nears the mystic strand. 
<P>We love her and we grieve to see her go. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is Christ who calls her to His breast, 
<BR>And He shall greet her, and she soon shall know 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The joys of souls that dwell among the blest.

<P>&quot;We walk upon the sea-shore, you and I, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just two alone,&quot; you say. But there are three; 
<BR>A tall and manly form is walking nigh, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And as I move, he moves along with me. 
<P>Your shadow? No, for shadows do not speak, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is speaking, tenderly and low,
<BR>Words that bring crimson blushes to my cheek, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot hear, the sea is sounding so. 
<P>But it is strange you cannot see him there, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My darling with the broad and snowy brow. 
<BR>You never saw a face so grandly fair. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll stand aside--there, do you see him now? 
<P>No! well you jest, or else you're growing blind; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue eyes are never very strong, you know; 
<BR>This summer sun and wind are bad combined, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;You should not walk here where the sea gales blow. 
<P>Ah, he who walks here at my side has eyes 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That sun, nor wind can dim their eagle sight, 
<BR>You've seen the thunder cloud in stormy skies--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, so his eyes are, full of purple light. 
<P>Dead! what a foolish thing for you to say,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ghosts in the room, 
<BR>As I sit here alone, from the dark corners there 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They come out of the gloom 
<BR>And they stand at my side, and they lean on my chair. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's the ghost of a hope 
<BR>That lighted my days with a fanciful glow. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her hand is the rope 
<BR>That strangled her life out. Hope was slain long ago. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her ghost comes to-night, 
<BR>With its skeleton face, and expressionless eyes, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it stands in the light, 
<BR>And mocks me, and jeers me with sobs and with sighs. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's the ghost of a Joy, 
<BR>A frail, fragile thing, and I prized it too much, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hands that destroy 
<BR>Clasped it close, and it died at the withering touch. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's the ghost of a love,
<BR>Born with joy, reared with Hope, died in pain and unrest, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he towers above 
<BR>All the others--this ghost: yet a ghost at the best. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am weary, and fain 
<BR>Would forget all these dead: but the gibbering host 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make the struggle in vain, 
<BR>In each shadowy corner, there lurketh a ghost.

<P>I was out promenading one fine summer day, 
<BR>When I chanced upon three bosom cronies to stray, 
<BR>And a beer shop we happened to pass on our way. 
<P>&quot;Now boys,&quot; said I, stopping them all with a wink, 
<BR>&quot;If you'll step round the corner, I'll treat to a drink; 
<BR>How is it, my hearties? now, what do you think?&quot; 
<P>So, into the bar-room we dropped in a flash, 
<BR>And up to the keeper I went with a dash: 
<BR>&quot;Four glasses of lager, and none of your trash, 
<BR>But the best and the foamiest money can bring,&quot; 
<BR>Was the order I gave, with the air of a king; 
<BR>And mine host fluttered off, like a bird on the wing. 
<P>Just then an old toper dropped in from the street, 
<BR>A jolly old soak, with a nose like a beet. 
<BR>And he said, &quot;Now, my rummys, I'll share in that treat.&quot; 
<P>But I said to my cronies, &quot;Say boys, look ye there! 
<BR>Do you 'spose such a nosey will fall to our share?&quot; 
<BR>Quoth the toper, &quot;Keep drinking, my lads, and you'll wear 
<BR>A nose like my own, or I miss in my guess.&quot; 
<BR>&quot;Why,&quot; said Ned, &quot;it resembles the light of distress.&quot; 
<BR>Said Tom, &quot;It's the color of Sally Ann's dress.&quot; 
<P>Said Billy, &quot;It looks like the sun's ruddy bed, 
<BR>And shines like the top of my grandfather's head.&quot; 
<BR>Said I, &quot;It is ready, I think, to be bled.&quot; 
<P>&quot;Now thank ye, my lads,&quot; said old soak with a bow, 
<BR>&quot;But gulp down your lager, 'twill soon show ye how 
<BR>Red noses are painted and polished, I vow.&quot; 
<P>I turned to my cronies: &quot;Now, boys, look ye here! 
<BR>I wouldn't, I say, for ten thousand a year, 
<BR>Have my nose grow to look like the one beaming near!&quot; 
<P>&quot;Nor I, sir!&quot; &quot;Nor I, sir!&quot; &quot;Nor I!&quot; cried each chum; 
<BR>Then, said I, &quot;A good-bye to all beer, ale, and rum, 
<BR>And hurrah for cold water! my boys, will ye come?&quot; 
<P>&quot;We are ready and willing,&quot; said Tom, Bill and Ned. 
<BR>&quot;Let's get us a pledge, boys, and sign it,&quot; I said--
<BR>And so at next meeting, four names were read 
<BR>In the Temperance column. And now should you be 
<BR>In these parts, and a fine-looking fellow should see, 
<BR>You may know it is one of my cronies, or me. 
<P>By lectures, and preaching, some fellows are won, 
<BR>But you see it is different with us: it was done 
<BR>By the jolly old soak, with a nose like the sun!

<P>Back on its golden hinges 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate of Memory swings, 
<BR>And my heart goes into the garden 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And walks with the olden things. 
<BR>The old-time, joys and pleasures. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The loves that it used to know, 
<BR>It meets there in the garden. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And they wander to and fro. 
<P>It heareth a peal of laughter,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;It seeth a face most fair. 
<BR>It thrills with a wild, strange rapture 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the glance of a dark eye there; 
<BR>It strayeth under the sunset 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of a merry throng, 
<BR>And beats in a tuneful measure, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the snatch of a floating song. 
<P>It heareth a strain of music 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Swell on the dreamy air, 
<BR>A strain that is never sounded, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Save in the garden there. 
<BR>It wanders among the roses, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And thrills at a long-lost kiss, 
<BR>And glows at the touch of fingers, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a tremor of foolish bliss. 
<P>But all is not fair in the garden,--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a sorrowing sob of pain; 
<BR>There are tear-drops, bitter, scalding, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the roses are tempest-slain. 
<BR>And I shut the gate of the garden. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And walk in the Present's ways. 
<BR>For its quiet paths are better
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the pain of those vanished days!

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;These waters, whereon some barks lose the shore, 
<BR>But draw me nearer to the Heavenly Host, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But make me love and worship God the more.

<BR>And death is waiting, near, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your darling walketh.&quot; 
<P>The winds came from the West,

<BR>And with an awful fear,

<P>One bitter time of mourning, I remember,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And all its pleasures, were but whited pain. 
<P>Nothing could rouse me from my sullen sorrow, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you were not near, I would not smile. 
<BR>And from a score of joys refused to borrow 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;One ray of light, to gild the weary while. 
<P>But all the blessing God has given, scorning, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I wept because we were so far apart, 
<BR>And spent my time in idle, aimless mourning, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That only kept the grief fresh in my heart--
<P>God pity me! I know now we were nearer. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these intervening miles of space--

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was lawless and wild; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, woman, or child 
<BR>Met no mercy, no pity, if found in his path. 
<BR>He was worse than a beast of the woods, in his wrath.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was sung to, and rocked, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he first walked

<BR>And summer blossoms speak all too plain 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the dear, dead forms beneath. 
<P>But let us talk of the past to-night; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And live it over again, 
<BR>We will put the long years out of sight. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And dream we are young as then. 
<BR>But you must not look at me, my friend, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I must not look at you, 
<BR>Or the furrowed brows, and silvered locks, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will prove our dream untrue. 
<P>Let us sing of the summer, too sweet to last. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet too sweet to die. 
<BR>Let us read tales, from the book of the past, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And talk of the days gone by. 
<BR>We will turn our backs to the West, my friend, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And forget we are growing old. 
<BR>The skies of the Present are dull, and gray, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Past's are blue, and gold. 
<P>The sun has passed over the noontide line 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And is sinking down the West. 
<BR>And of friends we knew in days Lang Syne, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Full half have gone to rest. 
<BR>And the few that are left on earth, my friend 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are scattered far, and wide. 
<BR>But you and I will talk of the days 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere any roamed, or died. 
<P>Auburn ringlets, and hazel eyes-- 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue eyes and tresses of gold. 
<BR>Winds joy laden, and azure skies, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Belong to those days of old. 
<BR>We will leave the Present's shores awhile 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And float on the Past's smooth sea. 
<BR>But I must not look at you, my friend, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And you must not look at me.

<P>This world is a sad, sad place I know; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And what soul living can doubt it. 
<BR>But it will not lessen the want and woe, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To be always singing about it. 
<BR>Then away with the songs that are full of tears,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Away with dirges that sadden. 
<BR>Let us make the most of our fleeting years, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;By singing the lays that gladden. 
<P>The world at its saddest is not all sad--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are days of sunny weather. 
<BR>And the people within it are not all bad, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But saints and sinners together. 
<BR>I think those wonderful hours in June, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are better by far, to remember, 
<BR>Than those when the world gets out of tune 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cold, bleak winds of November. 
<BR>Because we meet in the walks of life 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a selfish creature,
<BR>It does not prove that this world of strife 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Has no redeeming feature. 
<BR>There is bloom, and beauty upon the earth, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are buds and blossoming flowers, 
<BR>There are souls of truth, and hearts of worth--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are glowing, golden hours. 
<P>In thinking over a joy we've known, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We easily make it double. 
<BR>Which is better by far, than to mope and moan, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Over sorrow and grief and trouble. 
<BR>For though this world is sad, we know, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;(And who that is living can doubt it,) 
<BR>It will not lessen the want, or woe, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To be always singing about it.

<P>Walking to-day on the Common, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard a stranger say 
<BR>To a friend who was standing near him, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you know I am going away?&quot; 
<BR>I had never seen their faces: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;May never see them again, 
<BR>But the words the stranger uttered,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stirred me with nameless pain. 
<P>For I knew some heart would miss him,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Would ache at his &quot;going away,&quot; 
<BR>And the earth would seem all cheerless, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For many and many a day. 
<BR>No matter how glad my spirit, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how light my heart, 
<BR>If I hear these two words uttered. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The tear drops always start. 
<P>They are so sad and solemn, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So full of a lonely sound: 
<BR>Like dead leaves rustling downward, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And dropping upon the ground. 
<BR>Oh, I pity the naked branches, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the skies are dull and gray, 
<BR>And the last leaf whispers softly, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good bye, I am going away.&quot; 
<P>In the dreary, dripping Autumn, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings of the flying birds 
<BR>As they soar away to the southland, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem always to say these words. 
<BR>Where ever they may be uttered, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;They fall with a sob, and sigh; 
<BR>And heart-aches follow the sentence, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am going away--Good bye.&quot; 
<P>Oh, God, in Thy blessed kingdom 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No lips shall ever say, 
<BR>No ears shall ever hearken. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the words &quot;I am going away.&quot; 
<BR>For no soul ever wearies 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the dear, bright, angel band, 
<BR>And no saint ever wanders, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sunny, golden land.

<P>He rose, and passing, paused by her. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;They stood a moment in the door. 
<BR>His dark eyes made her pulses stir 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As they had never stirred before; 
<BR>How soft the night bird sang above 
<BR>The dull brown heath. Oh, Life, Oh, Love! 
<P>He took her hand, and said &quot;Good bye.&quot; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, singing blithely, went across 
<BR>The sodden fields: nor heard the cry 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her heart sent up, nor knew her loss. 
<BR>How bleak, and wild, and desolate, 
<BR>The wind blew down. Oh, Love, Oh, Fate! 
<P>The west turned suddenly aflame; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Striped here and there with blue and gold. 
<BR>She shook with chills she could not name. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The air seemed strangely harsh, and cold. 
<BR>How keen the winds were, and how rife 
<BR>With wintry sounds. Oh, Love, Oh, Life! 
<P>She waited till she saw him pass 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the meadow, out of sight. 
<BR>His shadow fell upon the grass; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The winds were talking of the night. 
<BR>How high they whirled the withered leaf; 
<BR>How swift it flew. Oh, Love, Oh, Grief. 
<P>She shut the door, and turned away. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some task was waiting for her hand. 
<BR>She shut another door, where lay, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sweet dead hope. You understand. 
<BR>&quot;And they shall weep no more,&quot; God saith, 
<BR>&quot;Nor taste of pain.&quot; Oh, Life, Oh, Death.

<BR>And Johnny and Jamie, the twins, came after, 
<BR>Setting the rafters, a-ring with laughter. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe for the words I said! 
<BR>I looked at the floor I had swept and dusted, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the litter the twelve feet brought; 
<BR>And I sighed, and frowned, on the six bright blossoms, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And frowning, spoke my thought. 
<P>&quot;Oh, was there ever so weary a woman! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been only twelve years wed. 
<BR>But I've never a moment of peace or quiet. 
<BR>Six rough boys, with their noise and riot, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are wearing me out,&quot; I said. 
<BR>&quot;Six rough boys to mend and work for, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To clothe and feed--it is hard at best; 
<BR>There's never an end to my weary labors, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no time for rest.&quot; 
<P>Dark fell the shadows around my little cottage, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeping I leaned over one little bed, 
<BR>Vain were the tears on the tiny face falling; 
<BR>In the dim distance I heard a voice calling--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come unto me,&quot; it said. 
<BR>And down through the starlight an angel descended, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood by my Jamie's low bedside. 
<BR>&quot;Come! there is room with the angels,&quot; she whispered, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Heaven is fair and wide.&quot; 
<P>&quot;Fair are its meadows, and wide are its mansions, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And thousands of children are gathered there.&quot; 
<BR>Vain were the prayers that I prayed, leaning o'er him, 
<BR>Up to the mansions of heaven she bore him. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe for my heart's despair! 
<BR>Oh, to recall the harsh words that I uttered! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, for his litter and noise to-day! 
<BR>Oh, for the labor his hands would make me! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands that are turned to clay. 
<P>Five sturdy boys troop into my cottage, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;John, Will, Sammy, and Bob and Fred--
<BR>Five brave boys as e'er blessed a mother. 
<BR>But always and ever I miss the other, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The dear, dear boy that is dead. 
<BR>I miss the ring of his childish laughter, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss him and mourn for him night and day, 
<BR>But wide are the mansions, and fair are the meadows

<P>There sat two glasses, filled to the brim,

<BR>One was ruddy, and red as blood, 
<BR>And one was as clear as the crystal flood. 
<P>Said the glass of wine to his paler brother, 
<BR>&quot;Let us tell tales of the past to each other; 
<BR>I can tell of banquet, and revel, and mirth, 
<BR>Where I was king, for I ruled in might. 
<BR>And the proudest and grandest souls on earth 
<BR>Fell under my touch, as though struck with blight. 
<BR>From the heads of kings, I have torn the crown,
<BR>From the heights of fame, I have hurled men down; 
<BR>I have blasted many an honored name, 
<BR>I have taken virtue, and given shame; 
<BR>I have tempted the youth, with a sip, a taste, 
<BR>That has made his future a barren waste. 
<BR>Far greater than any king am I, 
<BR>Or than any army beneath the sky. 
<BR>I have made the arm of the driver fail, 
<BR>And sent the train from its iron rail. 
<BR>I have made good ships go down at sea, 
<BR>And the shrieks of the lost were sweet to me; 
<BR>For they said, 'Behold, how great you be! 
<BR>Fame, strength, wealth, genius, before you fall, 
<BR>And your might and power are over all.'&quot; 
<BR>&quot;Ho! ho! pale brother,&quot; laughed the wine, 
<BR>&quot;Can you boast of deeds as great as mine?&quot; 
<P>Said the water glass, &quot;I cannot boast 
<BR>Of a king dethroned or a murdered host; 
<BR>But I can tell of hearts that were sad, 
<BR>By my crystal drops made light and glad. 
<BR>Of thirsts I have quenched, and brows I've laved; 
<BR>Of hands I have cooled, and souls I've saved. 
<BR>I have leaped through the valley, dashed down the mountain; 
<BR>Slept in the sunshine, and dripped from the fountain. 
<BR>I have burst my cloud fetters, and dropped from the sky, 
<BR>And everywhere gladdened the landscape and eye. 
<BR>I have eased the hot forehead of fever and pain, 
<BR>I have made the parched meadows grow fertile with grain; 
<BR>I can tell of the powerful wheel o' the mill, 
<BR>That ground out the flour, and turned at my will; 
<BR>I can tell of manhood, debased by you, 
<BR>That I have uplifted, and crowned anew. 
<BR>I cheer, I help, I strengthen and aid,

<P>The God of the day has vanished

<BR>And the hand of an unseen artist, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is painting the West all red. 
<BR>All threaded with gold and crimson, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And burnished with amber dye, 
<BR>And tipped with purple shadows, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory flameth high. 
<P>Fair, beautiful world of ours! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair, beautiful world, but oh. 
<BR>How darkened by pain and sorrow, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;How blackened by sin and woe, 
<BR>The splendor pales in the heavens 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And dies in a golden gleam, 
<BR>And alone in the hush of twilight, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit, in a checkered dream. 
<P>I think of the souls that are straying, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In shadows as black as night, 
<BR>Of hands that are groping blindly 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In search of the shining light; 
<BR>Of hearts that are mutely crying,

<P>I think of the Father's children

<BR>Oh, the paths are rough and thorny,

<P>Once, when the summer lay on the hilltops, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sunshine fell like a golden flame, 
<BR>Out from the city's dust and turmoil 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A gallant, fair-faced stranger came--
<BR>Came to rest in our humble cottage 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the winds of autumn should blow again, 
<BR>To walk in the meadow and lie by the brooklet, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And woo back the strength, that the town had slain. 
<P>I was young, with the foolish heart of a maiden 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That had never been wooed, and the stranger bland 
<BR>Awoke that heart from its idle dreaming, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And swept the strings with a master-hand. 
<BR>I remember the thrill, and the first wild tremor, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That stirred its depths with a sweet surprise, 
<BR>When I glanced one day at the handsome stranger, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And caught the gaze of his deep, dark eyes. 
<P>My cheek grew red with its tell-tale blushes, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the knitting dropped from my nerveless grasp; 
<BR>He stooped, and then, as he gracefully gave it, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He held my hand in a loving clasp; 
<BR>We said no word, but he knew my secret,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He read what lay in my maiden heart, 
<BR>No vain concealing was needed longer 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To hide the tremor his voice would start. 
<P>We walked in the meadow and by the brooklet, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My sun-browned hand in his snowy palm; 
<BR>He said my blushes would shame the roses, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And my heart stood still in a blissful calm. 
<BR>He stroked my tresses, my raven ringlets, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And twined them over his finger fair; 
<BR>My eyes' dark splendor was full of danger, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, for Cupid was lurking there. 
<P>And once he held me close to his bosom, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And pressed on my lips a loving kiss; 
<BR>Oh! how I tremble with shame and anger, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Even now, as I think of this--
<BR>But in that moment, I thought that heaven 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Had suddenly opened and drawn me in, 
<BR>And kissed with passion the lips, so near me,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor dreamed I was staining my soul with sin. 
<P>But there came a letter one quiet evening 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the man who was dearer to me than life--
<BR>&quot;A picture,&quot; he said, as he tore it open, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look, sweet friend, at my fair young wife.&quot; 
<BR>A terrible anguish, a seething anger,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaved my bosom and blanched my cheek, 
<BR>And he who stood there holding the letter,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched me smiling, but did not speak. 
<P>I took the picture and gazed upon it--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A sweet young creature with sunny hair 
<BR>And eyes of blue. &quot;May the good Lord keep you,&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I said aloud, &quot;in his tender care--
<BR>You who are wedded and bound forever 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto this man,&quot; and I met his eyes--
<BR>&quot;This soulless villain, this shameless coward, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose heart is blackened with acted lies.&quot; 
<P>My heart swelled full of a terrible hatred,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And something of murder was burning there,
<BR>But a better feeling stole in behind it 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As I looked on the picture sweet and fair; 
<BR>I turned and left him, and never saw him--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Never looked on his face again, 
<BR>And time has tempered my shame and sorrow, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And soothed and quieted down my pain. 
<P>But I always tremble, in awful anger, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That wears and worries my waning life,
<BR>When I think how he clasped me close to his bosom, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He--with a lawfully wedded wife. 
<BR>When I think how I answered his fond caresses, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And clung to his neck in a trance of bliss, 
<BR>And the tears of a life time and all my sorrow 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can never remove the stain of his kiss.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a robe of purest white. 
<BR>You shall wear the matchless mantle, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That the good Frost Fairy weaves.&quot; 
<BR>And the bare trees listened, wondered, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And forgot their fallen leaves. 
<P>And the quaint and silent fairy, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Backward, forward, through the gloom, 
<BR>Wove the matchless, glittering mantle, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Spun the frost-thread on her loom. 
<BR>And the bare trees talked together, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Talked in whispers soft and low, 
<BR>As the good and silent fairy 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved her shuttle to and fro. 
<P>And lo! when the golden glory 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the morning crept abroad, 
<BR>All the trees were clothed in grandeur,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;All the twiglets robed, and shod 
<BR>With matchless, spotless garments,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sunshine decked with gems,
<BR>And the trees forgot their sorrow, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;'Neath their robes and diadems.

<P>Did you see Florabelle? Has she passed you this morning? 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall, slender Maiden, with hair like spun gold. 
<BR>She has? then I pray you, dear sir, heed my warning, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just the old, oft rehearsed story re-told: 
<P>Florabelle is a jilt--a coquette--a deceiver. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She angles for hearts, with soft words and sweet smiles. 
<BR>Forewarned is forearmed, don't you trust or believe her, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Be deaf to her cooing, be blind to her wiles. 
<P>She has eyes, like the heart of a blue morning glory, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She has lips like a rose-bud just sprinkled with dew, 
<BR>'Tis the old hackneyed tale, 'tis the same wretched story, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman all fair, yet all false, and untrue. 
<P>With her soft silken hair, in its meshes and tangles,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With her pink and white cheek, and her full ruby lips,
<BR>With her eyes shining clear, like the heaven's bright sparkles, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She has wrecked as strong <i>hearts</i> as the ocean has ships. 
<P>Those blue eyes are ever on watch for a stranger; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She thirsts for fresh conquests, and she has marked you, 
<BR>I warn you, my friend, that your peace is in danger, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Take heed, lest the day that you met her, you rue. 
<P>Don't bask in her smiles, for one moment, but leave her, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you're entangled, and find it too late. 
<BR>Florabelle is a jilt--a coquet--a deceiver, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given you warning! now choose your own fate!

<P>I heard a low sound, like a troubled soul praying: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the winds of the winter night brought it to me. 
<BR> 'Twas the doomed city's voice: &quot;Oh, kind snow,&quot; it was saying, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come, cover my ruins, so ghastly to see, 
<BR>I am robbed of my beauty, and shorn of my glory; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the strength that I boasted--where is it to-day? 
<BR>I am down in the dust; and my pitiful story 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make tearless eyes weep, and unpious lips pray. 
<P>&quot;I--I, who have reveled in pomp and in power, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Am down on my knees, with my face in the dust. 
<BR>But yesterday queen, with a queen's royal dower, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day I am glad of a crumb or a crust. 
<BR>But yesterday reigning, a grand mighty city, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The pride of the nation, the queen of the West; 
<BR>To-day I am gazed at, an object of pity, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A charity child, asking alms, at the best. 
<P>&quot;My strength, and my pride, and my glory departed,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My fair features scorched by the fire fiend's breath, 
<BR>Is it strange that I'm soul-sick and sorrowful hearted? 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it strange that my thoughts run on ruin and death? 
<BR>Oh, white, fleecy clouds that are drooping above me, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hark, hark to my pleadings, and answer my sighs, 
<BR>And let down the beautiful snow, if you love me, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To cover my wounds from all pitying eyes, 
<P>&quot;I am hurled from my throne, but not hurled down forever, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall rise from the dust; I shall live down my woes--
<BR>But my heart lies to-day, like a dumb, frozen river; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When to thaw out and flow again, God only knows. 
<BR>Oh, sprites of the air! I beseech you to weave me 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A mantle of white snow, and beautiful rime

<P>Now God be with the men who stand

<BR>Those chosen princes of our land--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;May God be with them all, I say,
<BR>And may His wisdom, guide, and shield them,

<P>Oh, men! who hold a people's fate,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There in the hollow of your hand. 
<BR>Each word you utter, soon, or late, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall leave its impress on our land,--
<BR>Forth from the halls of legislation, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall speed its way, through all the Nation. 
<P>Then may The Source of Truth, and Light, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Be ever o'er you, ever near. 
<BR>And may He guide each word aright; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;May no false precept, greet the ear,
<BR>No selfish love, for purse, or faction,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay Justice's hand, or guide one action. 
<P>And may no one, among these men 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift to his lips, the damning glass, 
<BR>Let no man say, with truth, again, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;What <i>has been</i> said, in truth, alas, 
<BR>&quot;Men drink, in halls of legislation--

<P>Oh, men! you see, you hear this beast,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;This fiend that pillages the earth. 
<BR>Whose work is death--whose hourly feast, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is noble souls, and minds of worth--
<BR>You see--and if you will not chain him,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor reach one hand forth, to detain him. 
<P>For God's sake, do not give him aid,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor urge him onward. Oh, to me, 
<BR>It seems so strange that laws are made 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To crush all other crimes, while he 
<BR>Who bears down through Hell's gaping portals 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless souls, of rum wrecked mortals, 
<P>Is left to wander, to, and fro, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In perfect freedom through the land. 
<BR>And those who ought to see, and know,

<P>Gather them out of the valley--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring them from moorland and hill,
<BR>And cast them in wreaths and in garlands. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the city so silent and still--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So voiceless, so silent, and still; 
<BR>Where neighbor speaks never to neighbor, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the song of the bird, and the brown bee is heard, 
<BR>But never the harsh sounds of labor. 
<P>Bring them from woodland and meadow--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As fresh, and as fair, as can be. 
<BR>Bring them, all kinds, and all colors. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That grow upon upland and lea--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That spring in wild grace on the lea. 
<BR>And rifle the green earth's warm bosom 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of each flower, and blow, till &quot;God's acre&quot; shall glow 
<BR>And bloom, like a garden in blossom.
<P>Bring them from vase, and from hot-house, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And strew them with bountiful hand. 
<BR>There is nothing too rare for the soldier, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who laid down his life for his land--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who laid down <i>all things</i> for his land; 
<BR>And turned to the duty before him, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And how now can we prove, our thanks and our love 
<BR>But by casting these May blossoms o'er him. 
<P>We know they will soon fade, and wither--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We know they will soon droop, and die; 
<BR>But one time, I read, how an angel 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Came down from the mansions on high--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night, from God's kingdom on high--
<BR>Came down where a poor faded flower 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay crushed by rude feet, in the dust of the street,
<BR>And he carried it up to God's bower; 
<P>And laid it before the Good Master, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who kissed it, and passed it to Christ, 
<BR>On the throne at His side; and <i>He</i> kissed it, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the touch of those kisses sufficed--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The caress of the God-head sufficed--
<BR>And it bloomed out in wonderful splendor, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing of delight, and most fair in God's sight--
<BR>'Tis a fable, I know; but so tender; 
<P>So sweet that I like to believe it--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have been thinking, to-day,
<BR>That mayhap these soldiers, now angels, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will come, when these wreathes fade away--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When they wither, and shrivel away--
<BR>And will bear the crushed things up to heaven, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And God, and His Son will kiss them, each one, 
<BR>And new beauty, and bloom will be given. 
<P>And odd fancy, perhaps, yet dispute it. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And prove it untrue if you can. 
<BR>There are strange, subtle ways, in God's workings 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now veiled from the knowledge of man,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut out from the vision of man.--
<BR>By a dark veil of deep, mortal blindness; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But when God deems it right, He will give us our sight,
<BR>And remove the thick veil, in His kindness; 
<P>And when we have entered His kingdom, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And all his strange ways understand, 
<BR>Who knows but these very same flowers,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall find there abloom, in His land,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;All fresh, and all fair, in His land; 
<BR>And these soldiers, who went on before us, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As we wander and stray, through God's gardens, shall say: 
<BR>&quot;These are the wreathes you cast o'er us.&quot; 
<P>Then, strew ye the best, and the brightest 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of buds, and of blossoms full blown, 
<BR>Over the graves, of the loved ones--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Over those labelled &quot;Unknown!&quot; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! the pathos of that word, &quot;Unknown!&quot; 
<BR>Bring hither the brightest, and rarest! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We reck not, if the clay, wore the blue garb, or gray! 
<BR>We will give them the best, and the fairest. 
<P>For somebody mourned for the &quot;missing,&quot; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And wept for them hot, scalding tears, 
<BR>And hoped against hope, for their coming; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And watched, and waited, months and years,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Such long, and such desolate years! 
<BR>But the hearts are <i>so</i> patient, that love them,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And some now watch and weep, for the soldiers who sleep 
<BR>With the slab labeled &quot;Unknown&quot; above them. 
<P>Then gather from meadow, and woodland, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;From garden, and hot-house, and vase, 
<BR>The brightest and choicest of blossoms, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And scatter them here in this place; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;This holy and hallowed place--
<BR>This city of rest, not of labor, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where only the bird, and th' brown bee is heard, 
<BR>And neighbor, speaks never to neighbor.

<P>I knew that a baby was hid in that house,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That the woman before me was certainly that,
<BR>For there lay in the corner a tiny cloth shoe, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I saw on a stand such a wee little hat; 
<BR>And the beard of the husband said plain as could be, 
<BR>&quot;Two fat, chubby hands have been tugging at me.&quot; 
<P>And he took from his pocket a gay picture book,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And a dog that would bark if you pulled on a string;

<P>After the battles are over, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the war drums cease to beat, 
<BR>And no more is heard on the hillside 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of hurrying feet,
<BR>Full many a noble action, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That was done in the days of strife, 
<BR>By the soldier is half forgotten,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the peaceful walks of life. 
<P>Just as the tangled grasses, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In summer's warmth and light, 
<BR>Grow over the graves of the fallen 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And hide them away from sight, 
<BR>So many an act of valor, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a deed sublime, 
<BR>Fades from the mind of the soldier, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;O'ergrown by the grass of time. 
<P>Not so should they be rewarded, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Those noble deeds of old; 
<BR>They should live forever and ever,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the heroes' hearts are cold. 
<BR>Then rally, ye brave old comrades, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Old veterans, re-unite! 
<BR>Up root time's tangled grasses--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Live over the march, and the fight. 
<P>Let Grant come up from the White House, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And clasp each brother's hand,
<BR>First chieftain of the army, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Last chieftain of the land. 
<BR>Let him rest from a nation's burdens, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And go, in thought, with his men, 
<BR>Through the fire and smoke of Shiloh, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And save the day again. 
<P>This silent hero of battles, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew no such word as <i>defeat</i>. 
<BR>It was left for the rebels learning. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the word retreat. 
<BR>He was not given to <i>talking</i>, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But he found that guns would preach 
<BR>In a way that was more convincing 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Than fine and flowery speech. 
<P>Three cheers for the grave commander 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the grand old Tennessee! 
<BR>Who won the first great battle--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gained the first great victory. 
<BR>His motto was always &quot;Conquer,&quot; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Success&quot; was his countersign, 
<BR>And &quot;though it took all summer,&quot; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept fighting upon &quot;that line.&quot; 
<P>Let Sherman, the stern old General, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Respond to the reveille,
<BR>Let him march with his boys through Georgia, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;From &quot;Atlanta down to the sea.&quot; 
<BR>Oh, that grand old tramp to Savannah! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hundred miles to the coast! 
<BR>It will live in the heart of the Nation,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When a score of miles away, 
<BR>* He has come to the feast and banquet. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;By the iron horse to-day. 
<BR>Its space is not much swifter 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the pace of that famous steed 
<BR>That bore him down to the contest 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And saved the day by his speed. 
<P>Then go over the ground to-day, boys, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tread each remembered spot. 
<BR>It will be a gleesome journey, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the swift-shod feet of thought; 
<BR>You can fight a bloodless battle, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can skirmish along the route, 
<BR>But it's not worthwhile to forage, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are rations enough without. 
<P>Don't start if you hear the cannon; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the sound of doom, 
<BR>It does not call to the contest--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the battle's smoke and gloom. 
<BR>&quot;Let us have Peace,&quot; was spoken. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! peace ruled again; 
<BR>And now the nation is shouting, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the cannon's voice, &quot;Amen.&quot; 
<P>Oh, boys, who besieged old Vicksburg, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can time e'er wash away 
<BR>The triumph of her surrender, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine years ago to-day? 
<BR>Can you ever forget the moment,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you saw that flag of white,
<BR>That told how the grim old city 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Had fallen in her might? 
<P>Ah, 'twas a bold, brave army,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boys with a right good will,
<BR>Went gayly marching and singing 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the fight at Champion Hill. 
<BR>They met with a warm reception,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But the soul of &quot;Old John Brown&quot; 
<BR>Was abroad on that field of battle, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And our flag did NOT go down. 
<P>Come, heroes of Look Out Mountain, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Corinth and Donelson, 
<BR>Of Kenesaw and Atlanta, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell how the day was won! 
<BR>Hush! bow the head for a moment--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are those who cannot come. 
<BR>No bugle call can arouse them--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No sound of fife, or drum. 
<P>McPherson fell in the battle, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When its waves were surging high. 
<BR>Brave Ransom sank by the wayside; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas a lonely death to die. 
<BR>They walk God's fair, green meadows,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;They dwell in a land of bliss,
<BR>Yet I think their spirits are with us

<P>Oh, boys who died for the country,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, dear and sainted dead! 
<BR>What can we say about you 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That has not once been said?

<BR>To rescue a periled Nation, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And we give you deathless fame. 
<BR>'Twas the cause of Truth and Justice 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That you fought and perished for,
<BR>And we say it, oh, so gently, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Our boys who died in the war.&quot; 
<P>Saviours of our Republic, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroes who wore the blue,
<BR>We owe the peace that surrounds us--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And our Nation's strength, to you. 
<BR>We owe it to you that our banner,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The fairest flag in the world 
<BR>Is to-day unstained, unsullied,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the summer air unfurled. 
<P>We look on its stripes and spangles,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And our hearts are filled the while 
<BR>With love for the brave commanders,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the boys of the rank and file. 
<BR>The grandest deeds of valor, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Were never written out, 
<BR>The noblest acts of virtue,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The world knows nothing about. 
<P>And many a private soldier,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who walks his humble way,
<BR>With no sounding name or title,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown to the world to-day, 
<BR>In the eyes of God is a hero; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;All such he will reward, 
<BR>No deed however secret, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is hidden from the Lord. 
<P>Brave men of a mighty army, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We extend you friendships hand! 
<BR>I speak for the &quot;Loyal Women,&quot; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Those pillars of our land. 
<BR>We wish you a hearty welcome,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are proud that you gather here 
<BR>To talk of old times together 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On this brightest day in the year. 
<P>And if peace, whose snow-white pinions, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Brood over our land to-day, 
<BR>Should ever again go from us, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;(God grant she may ever stay). 
<BR>Should our Nation call in her peril 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For &quot;Six hundred thousand more,&quot; 
<BR>The loyal women would hear her, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And send you out as before. 
<P>We would bring out the treasured knapsack. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We would take the sword from the wall, 
<BR>And hushing our own heart's pleadings,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear only the country's call. 
<BR>For next to our God, is our Nation: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And we cherish the honored name,
<BR>Of the bravest of all brave armies 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who fought for that Nation's fame.

<BR>The sun draws on a veil of haze, 
<BR>And dreams away these golden days. 
<P>&quot;Put by the pen--lay thought aside,
<BR>And cease to battle with the tide,
<BR>Let us, like Nature, rest and dream 
<BR>And float with th' current of the stream.&quot; 
<P>So pleads my heart. I answer &quot;Nay, 
<BR>Work waits for you and me to-day. 
<BR>Behind these autumn hours of gold,
<BR>The winter lingers, bleak and cold. 
<P>&quot;And those who dream too long or much, 
<BR>Must waken, shivering, at his touch, 
<BR>With naught to show for vanished hours,
<BR>But dust of dreams and withered flowers. 
<P>&quot;So now, while days are soft and warm, 
<BR>We must make ready for the storm.&quot; 
<BR>Thus, through the golden, hazy weather, 
<BR>My heart and I converse together. 
<P>And yet, I dare not turn my eyes 
<BR>To pebbly shores or tender skies, 
<BR>Because I am so fain to do 
<BR>E'en as my heart pleads with me to.

<H3><I><A id="JamesBuell">LINES WRITTEN UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES BUELL</A></I></H3>
<P>Something is missing from the balmy spring. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no perfume in its gentle breath; 
<BR>And there are sobs in songs the wild birds sing. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the bees chant of the grave and death,
<BR>Something is missing from the earth. One morn 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The angels called a new name on the roll; 
<BR>A spirit soldier to their ranks was borne, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And all Christ's army welcomed the pure young soul. 
<P>He died. Two little words, but only God 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can understand the awful depths of woe 
<BR>They hold for those who pass beneath the rod, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Praying for strength, from Him who aimed the blow. 
<BR>He died. The soldier who fought long and well, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who walked with Death upon the battle-field,
<BR>Among the bellowing guns--the shrieking shell--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In poison prison dens--and would not yield. 
<P>A six month three times told, he languished there, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet he lived; oh, young heart, strong and brave! 
<BR>Thank God, who heard the oft repeated prayer; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank God, he does not fill a Southern grave; 
<BR>That when he died, the loved ones gathered round, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And eased the anguish of those last, sad hours. 
<BR>That gentle hands can keep the precious mound 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;All green with mosses, and abloom with flowers. 
<P>He was so young and fair; and life was sweet. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ give the mourners strength to drain the cup! 
<BR>He went to make the Heavenly ranks complete, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;God sent the angel Death, to bear him up. 
<BR>So young, and fair and brave; beloved by all; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The lisping child--life's veteran, bent and gray--
<BR>And eyes grow dim, and bitter tear-drops fall 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the mound where lies the soldier's clay. 
<P>Oh! it is sweet to feel that God knows best,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who called in youth this brother, friend and son, 
<BR>And sweet to lean upon the Saviour's breast, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking upward, say, &quot;Thy will be done.&quot; 
<BR>But something is missing from the balmy spring; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no perfume in its gentle breath, 
<BR>And there are sobs in songs the wild birds sing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the bees chant of the grave, and death.

<H3><I><A id="UnderWillow">UNDER THE WILLOW</A></I></H3>
<P>Under the willow, you and I 
<BR>Walked in the gloaming, when love ran high; 
<BR>That wild first love, that was almost pain, 
<BR>That we never on earth can know again. 
<P>The winds were soft, and the night was calm; 
<BR>You held my hand in your throbbing palm. 
<BR>With the fire of passion your dark eyes glowed, 
<BR>And the tide of my pulses madly flowed. 
<P>You drew me closely against your side--
<BR>You asked me softly to be your bride. 
<BR>I trembled, and flushed, and could not speak,
<BR>But you knew my answer, and kissed my cheek. 
<P>&quot;When earth has perished, and time is dead. 
<BR>Our love will still live on,&quot; we said. 
<BR>&quot;It shall have a steady and quenchless ray, 
<BR>Though youth and strength, and life decay.&quot; 
<P>The night-bird warbled a song just then; 
<BR>It sounded to us like a glad amen, 
<BR>As we built our castles, and made our vows, 
<BR>Under the willow's drooping boughs. 
<P class="centered"> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
<P>Under the willows, to and fro 
<BR>We walked in the gloaming, when love ran low. 
<BR>The tide had ebbed, the current dried, 
<BR>And our wild, mad passion had slowly died. 
<P>I know not wherefore, but widely apart 
<BR>We had steadily drifted, heart from heart. 
<BR>Something invisible came between--
<BR>I know not what--it was fate, I ween. 
<P>The scales had dropped from our youthful eyes, 
<BR>And we viewed each other in strange surprise; 
<BR>And she you deemed an angel before, 
<BR>You found was a woman--and nothing more. 
<P>And the idol I worshiped for gold, alway, 
<BR>I found was the poorest kind of clay. 
<BR>And so it perished, at one cold breath,
<BR>The passion we said would live through death. 
<P>And under the willow again we strayed, 
<BR>And sundered the vows that once were made. 
<BR>We felt no sorrow--we knew no woe--
<BR>Since <i>love</i> had perished, 'twere better so. 
<P>We have dreamt our dream; we have reached the end. 
<BR>You said so calmly, &quot;farewell, my friend.&quot; 
<BR>The night-bird uttered a wailing cry; 
<BR>It sounded to me like a last good-bye. 
<P>I am glad that we sundered our vows, that night. 
<BR>My pathway is pleasant, my heart is light. 
<BR>But I feel, my friend, as the days flow on, 
<BR>That something of youth from my life is gone. 
<P>And never, on earth, can we know again, 
<BR>That first, mad passion, so near to pain, 
<BR>When under the willow, you and I 
<BR>Walked in the gloaming, and love ran high. 
<BR>
<H3><I><A id="Doubting">DOUBTING</A></I></H3>
<P>Sometimes we mortals, writhing in bitter anguish, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crushed by great griefs, that seem too hard to bear, 
<BR>And led to doubt God's goodness and his wisdom, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And will not lift our burdened hearts in prayer. 
<BR>I think these moments are the very darkest, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The blackest and the coldest that we know, 
<BR>And I think God, and Christ, and all the angels, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pity us most, in this phase of our woe. 
<P>I had a little child I fondly cherished; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A winsome, playful, tender-hearted boy, 
<BR>Strong willed, yet gentle, gay, yet mild and loving. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He was our household idol and our joy. 
<BR>We lavished on him stores of pure affection; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We gave him the best love our hearts possessed, 
<BR>We dressed him in rich robes of finest texture, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And gazing on him, felt this earth life-blest. 
<P>We taught him all things good, and true, and noble; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We told him of the dear Lord crucified; 
<BR>We planned for him a bright and happy future; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We guarded him from danger--yet he died. 
<BR>Not all the gold and riches we might lavish, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all our gold could save him from the tomb. 
<BR>He died! and when the sweet eyes closed forever, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;They shut the sunshine in, and left but gloom. 
<P>To-day I saw a drunkard's child--a vagrant; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill-clad, ill-fed, uncombed, unwashed, and wild; 
<BR>His home the street--his lessons vice and sorrow--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;His garments rags--his youthful lips defiled 
<BR>With rum, tobacco, lies and loud blaspheming; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;What can his future be, but one of crime? 
<BR>And thinking of this, and of my boy who slumbered, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart felt hard, just for a little time. 
<P>It seemed so strange, that he, a homeless vagrant,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unloved, unloving, treading the road to sin, 
<BR>That he was spared; and mine so fondly cherished--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine so beloved, whose life seemed so twined in 
<BR>And round our heart strings, that when he was taken, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;It left them torn and bleeding--he should die; 
<BR>Ah me, it seemeth strange; and yet God's wisdom 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I can not doubt, nor must I question why. 
<P>He, being all-wise, Father, King, Creator, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be strange, if you, or I should know 
<BR>All that He knows, or understand His wisdom, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;All things He does, or why He does them so. 
<BR>Were all this plain, unto our mortal vision,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There would be nothing new to learn above; 
<BR>So, though the cross be great, and the prize hidden, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I need not doubt His wisdom or His love.

<P>I sit at my cottage window,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the sun's last rays, 
<BR>And the hill-tops glow with splendor, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the west is all ablaze. 
<BR>My room is flooded with glory, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul, with a wild delight, 
<BR>And my heart is filled with poems, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That I can not speak, or write. 
<P>O, darker, and deeper, and grander, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory flames on high. 
<BR>And I trace the walls of a city,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In that beautiful western sky: 
<BR>A city all gold and crimson--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;All purple and amber red; 
<BR>And the streets are paved with crystal,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the feet of angels tread. 
<P>O, soulless pen and pencil. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy efforts are weak and vain; 
<BR>The pen of the poet falters. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And his heart is full of pain: 
<BR>And the artist drops his pencil, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And weeps in mute despair, 
<BR>For he cannot paint the glory 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That lies in the sunset there. 
<P>But the city fadeth--fadeth; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory turns to grey; 
<BR>The golden lights are dying, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the splendor melts away. 
<BR>And I know it was only the shadow 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the city built on high--
<BR>Only the poor, pale shadow, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That I saw in the sunset sky. 
<P>And I long for that other city--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The city that God hath made, 
<BR>Where the glory never paleth. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the splendors never fade. 
<BR>O, there at the feet of Jesus, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In anthems of praise, I know 
<BR>My soul shall utter the poems 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That fill it to overflow.

<P>The sweet maid, Day, has pillowed her head 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the breast of her dusky lover Night; 
<BR>The sun has made her a couch of red, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And woven a cover of dim twilight; 
<BR>And the lover kisses the maiden's brow, 
<BR>As low on her couch she sleepeth now. 
<P>Here at my window, above the street, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit, as the day lies in repose; 
<BR>And I list to the ceaseless tramp of feet. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I watch this human tide that flows, 
<BR>Upward and downward, to and fro. 
<BR>As the waves of an ocean, ebb and flow. 
<P>Over and over the busy town,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither and thither, through all the day; 
<BR>One goes up, and another down--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each in his own allotted way. 
<BR>Strangers and kinsmen pass and meet, 
<BR>And jar, and jostle upon the street. 
<P>People that never met before--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;People that never will meet again: 
<BR>A careless glance of the eye--no more, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And both are lost in the sea of men.

<BR>Whether it's in or out of the town, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To a haunt of sin, or a home of rest,

<P>Strangers and kinsmen, friend and foe, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether their aims are great or small,

<P>Not always those who walk on steadily,

<BR>Whose raiments seem of spotless purity,

<BR>And hovers near, to comfort and to bless,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And holds for each fair brow a starry crown--
<P>Yet there are those, who sometimes wander out 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Into forbidden paths of sin, and grief, 
<BR>Who sometimes hover on the brink of doubt,

<P>I said, last winter, When the grasses grow,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are flowers abloom in every place,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I shall meet my darling face to face;

<BR>And yet--and yet--my darling does not come. 
<P>Alas! for never will she come again,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;She sleepeth, sleepeth, still and silent now; 
<BR>Her couch is hollowed from the grassy plain,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And daisies bloom and blow above her brow;

<P>I think true love is something like a tree; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The oak, that lifts its branches to the sky. 
<BR>The woodman's axe may strike it fatally, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or it may fall, when mighty winds sweep by. 
<BR>And where it grew, the flowers may bloom instead, 
<BR>And all may seem as though the tree were dead. 
<P>But underneath the grass, and flowers, there lies, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hid from the gaping world, a tiny root, 
<BR>A little living germ, that never dies; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever and anon its branches shoot 
<BR>Up through the earth, and mock, and strive to be 
<BR>The mighty forest king--the parent tree. 
<P>So love may wither, at the hand of Fate, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or fall beneath the killing winds that blow; 
<BR>And other loves may spring up, soon or late, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And flowers of forgetfulness may grow, 
<BR>Over the spot where love once grew instead,
<BR>And we may think the old-time passion dead. 
<P>And still the little germ lies in the heart, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So closely hidden that it is not known; 
<BR>And ever and anon its branches start--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vain mimics of the passion that has flown. 
<BR>Though love, once slain, can live not, as of yore,

<H3><I><A id="RobinTold">THE TALE THE ROBIN TOLD</A></I></H3>
<P>I walked to-day, in the grassy dell, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the cunning ground-bird hides her nest, 
<BR>And just where the plum-tree's shadow fell, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat me down for a while to rest. 
<BR>And a robin came, and sat in the tree, 
<BR>And told a long-lost tale to me. 
<P>Of a maiden, pure as the morning light, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And fresh as a white rose, bathed in dew. 
<BR>Of a youth with eyes like a stormy night, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And a heart that nothing of candor knew. 
<BR>And all through the valley, green and fair, 
<BR>The youth and the maiden wandered there. 
<P>He plucked the violets, blue and pale,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The lily white, and the roses red,
<BR>With every flower that decked the vale--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But the maid was fairest of all, he said. 
<BR>And the robin saw him kiss her cheek, 
<BR>And the maiden blushed, but did not speak. 
<P>And he held her hand, in a lover's way, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And he saw the blush that his glance awoke, 
<BR>And with eye, and tone, he seemed to say 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The words that his false lips never spoke.
<BR>And of her strength, and her life a part, 
<BR>Was the love that grew in the maiden's heart. 
<P>But the summer died, and the autumn came, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the maiden walked in the vale alone; 
<BR>And the hopeless love, like a scorching flame,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Burned out her life, but she made no moan. 
<BR>And she drooped, and died, as the year grew old, 
<BR>And this was the tale that the robin told. 
<BR>
<H3><I><A id="Memory">A MEMORY</A></I></H3>
<P>Oh, do you remember that night, long ago,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I gave you the rose from my hair? 
<BR>And you whispered, &quot;I'll wear it close over my heart, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As I cherish the sweet giver there?&quot; 
<P>'Twas a long time ago? you've forgotten, perhaps, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That such a thing ever occurred. 
<BR>But to-night, as I sit in the firelight's glow, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart's with the memory stirred. 
<P>And I seem to live over my girlhood again,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When my life was as warm as the spring: 
<BR>Before it had read the sharp lesson of pain, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you were my hero, arid king. 
<P>Oh! you were not worthy the love that I gave, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the sun in midsummer, it burned; 
<BR>While a passionless fancy, an idle day-dream, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the poor, shallow thing you returned. 
<P>Long ago--long ago! time has softened the pain,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That threatened to shadow my life. 
<BR>I am older, and wiser I think, now, than then,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And you have a beautiful wife--
<P>As pure as the angels, as fair, too, they say, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With her blue eyes and snowy-white lid. 
<BR>But I cannot help wondering, here to myself, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;If she loves you as well as I did. 
<P>Ah me! it can never harm you, or your bride, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For me to dream over that night,
<BR>When you whispered sweet words o'er the rose from my hair. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And my foolish heart throbbed in delight.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days flow on, and on,

<BR>Another year has vanished and gone, 
<BR>As the waves of the sea wash out the track 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shining sands o' th' shore. 
<BR>And patience waneth, and hope is spent, 
<BR>As I wait and watch for the one who went, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cometh to me no more. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring-time lived and died, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the summer followed fast; 
<BR>And I watched through both, with a heart that cried, 
<BR>For the one who vanished into the past,

<BR>Who sailed in a good ship over the sea,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The autumn, gold and brown,

<BR>And the rain and my tears fell down and down,
<BR>As day by day, I stood by the wave. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cried aloud in my pain. 
<BR>But what cares the sea for a tortured soul! 
<BR>It mocks at grief, and the breakers roll,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing a loud refrain. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never a word from thee,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a silence deep as death; 
<BR>Though the winter gleameth on moor and lea,
<BR>And the cold, cold wind, with its cruel breath, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blows over the angry sea. 
<BR>Yet alway and ever, till life is done,

<P>Farther apart, each day, our lives are drifting;

<BR>The clouds between us show no signs of lifting,

<P>Drifting apart! the visions that I've cherished,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To garland the grave that is made in my heart. 
<BR>Your image is ever about me--before me, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your voice floats abroad on the voice of the wind; 
<BR>And the spell of your presence, in absence, is o'er me, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dead of the past, in the present I find. 
<P>I cannot forget you. The one boon ungiven,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The boon of your love, is the cross that I bear. 
<BR>In the midnight of sorrow, I vainly have striven 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To crush in my heart the sweet image hid there; 
<BR>To banish the beautiful dreams that are thronging 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The halls of my memory--dreams worse than vain; 
<BR>For the one drop withheld, I am thirsting and longing, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the one joy denied, I am weeping in pain. 
<P>I would not forget you. I live to remember 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful hopes that bloomed but to decay,
<BR>And brighter than June glows the bleakest December, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When peopled with ghosts of the dreams passed away. 
<BR>Once loving you truly, I love you forever; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I mourn not in weak, idle grief for the past; 
<BR>But the love in my bosom can never, oh never 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass out, or another pass in, first or last.

<P>As a mother who dies in travail--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who closes her eyes in death, 
<BR>And sinks in the sleep that is long and deep, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With her babe's first wailing breath,
<BR>In the hush of the midnight watches,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the old year passed away,
<BR>And the new was born, and was hailed this morn, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As the &quot;Happy New Year Day.&quot; 
<P>The day when our eyes look backward, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To see what our hands have done, 
<BR>Through the hours of gold that the dead year told, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the beads of a pious Nun--
<BR>When we shut up the blotted ledger, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With its record of joy and grief, 
<BR>Of losses and gains, and pleasures and pains,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And turn to the new white leaf 
<P>We hoped, we planned, and we promised, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the year that is dead was young: 
<BR>But our hopes are like leaves that are withered,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the year like a song that is sung. 
<BR>We planned out some wonderful project,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That should bring to us riches and fame: 
<BR>Hour by hour, day by day, our plans fell away,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And our project was only a name. 
<P>We promised that life should be better, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sphere of our labors grew broad, 
<BR>That &quot;those things behind&quot; should pass from the mind,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As we reached for the prize of our God. 
<BR>But alas, for the promises given! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo, what were our good resolves worth? 
<BR>They were lost to our sight, and we strayed from the light,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And worshiped the poor things of earth. 
<P>And so, while we builded our castles, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With turrets of sapphire and gold,
<BR>Till they glowed in the sun, the months one by one, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Slipped away, and the year grew old--
<BR>Grew feeble and old and departed 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadows and gloom of the night; 
<BR>And some said 'twas a year full of sorrow, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And some, 'twas a year of delight. 
<P>Some, sitting in darkness and weeping, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sob, &quot;Oh. but the year was so long!&quot; 
<BR>And some, full of cheer, say the beautiful year 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Was only one verse of a song. 
<BR>To some it brought gladness and pleasure,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To others but sorrow and gloom. 
<BR>It gave one the sweet orange blossoms,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another, the dust of the tomb. 
<P>There are mothers to-day who are sitting, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With arms that are aching to hold 
<BR>The small form of grace, and the dear little face, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the head with its crown of spun gold; 
<BR>And they think of the last happy New Year, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the voice that made music all day, 
<BR>And, sitting alone in the silence, they moan,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the babe that is hidden away. 
<P>There are maidens, in love-letters, reading 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The story so old and so new; 
<BR>And their happy hearts beat, in a rhythm so sweet, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As they read of the love strong and true; 
<BR>And they think that of all the glad New Years, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never another so glad; 
<BR>And they heed not the wail of the mother, so pale, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who thinks the day dreary and sad. 
<P>There are some leaning over the coffin 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a hope that went out with the year; 
<BR>And their sad eyes are dry, and the lips white that cry, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The hope of a life-time lies here.&quot; 
<BR>God pity and comfort such mourners, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For God alone knoweth the pain 
<BR>Of these suffering hearts, when a dear hope departs, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And is buried to rise not again. 
<P>It is sad to lean over a loved one, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And cover the face with a pall,
<BR>But who mourns, with bowed head, o'er a hope that is dead, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the bitterest sorrow of all. 
<BR>God grant that this New Year may bring them, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some other hope, fully as sweet; 
<BR>May it cull the bright flowers from happiness' bowers,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And cast them in wreaths at their feet. 
<P>Despair and delight walk together; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunshine falls over the tomb; 
<BR>And close by the weary, whose lives are all dreary,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk those who are crowned with earth's bloom. 
<BR>Some wearing the laurels of glory, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And flushed with the glow of success, 
<BR>May their wreaths never pale, or their honors grow stale. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or their hopes or their happiness less. 
<P>Oh, wonderful year that has left us! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of tragedy, sorrow and change,
<BR>Was there ever another so fateful,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there ever another so strange? 
<BR>Great hearts that were throbbing last New Year 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are food for the grave-worms to-day,
<BR>And lips whose least word a whole nation heard,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are nothing but cold, silent clay. 
<P>There was one who was crowned with the Fern Leaves, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose ringing tones, full of good cheer,
<BR>Lightened hearts that were sad, and made weary ones glad, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On many a weary New Year. 
<BR>There was one double-dowered by heaven, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice gifted and favored by God, 
<BR>REID, whose brush, and whose pen, made him king among men,--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He, too, lieth under the sod. 
<P>And another, the hero of battles. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before whom the enemy fled 
<BR>In alarm and dismay, while he won the day, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;MEAD,--warrior and hero, is dead. 
<BR>There was one who climbed up the steep ladder,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step, on rounds that he made; 
<BR>And carved out his name, on the summit of Fame, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In letters that never will fade. 
<P>He struggled for knowledge and riches, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Position and glory, and <i>won</i>. 
<BR>But, reaching too far, like a child for a star,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell, with the words, &quot;It is done!&quot; 
<BR>It is done, all the climbing and toiling; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is done, all the worry and strife, 
<BR>All the bitter and sweet, th' success and defeat,--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is done, the great drama of life. 
<P>It is done, all the year could do for us, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Its mixture of shadow and sun,
<BR>Its smiles and its tears, its hopes and its fears, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Its labors and duties, all done. 
<BR>We stand face to face with the New Year, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor know what it hides from our sight; 
<BR>God grant that it be kind to you, and to me, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That it lead us in ways that are light. 
<P>The bells in the steeples are joyful, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The children are shouting in glee, 
<BR>There is mirth and good cheer in the happy New Year--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;All hail to young '73! 
<BR>Come out of the shadows, ye mourners! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And drop, for this one day at least,
<BR>Your mantles of woe, and let us all go 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And take part in the revel and feast. 
<P>Let us laugh like gay children together, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgetting we ever shed tears--
<BR>Forgetting the losses, the sorrows and crosses 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That came to our lives with the years--
<BR>Remembering only the perfume,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty, the bloom, and the sun, 
<BR>Let us talk of the New Years departed,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And call this the happiest one.

<P>A year that was solemn, and sad and strange, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Has passed away to its tomb, 
<BR>Since we made the graves of our dear, dead braves 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a garden, all abloom,--
<BR>A year that brought sorrow, and want, and change-- 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A year with a fateful breath: 
<BR>And the dreaded beat of its flame-shod feet 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrought ruin, and woe, and death. 
<P>High and higher the tongues of fire 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped up in a single night, 
<BR>Till the walls of a town went crumbling down, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And a city fell in her might. 
<BR>And with flame and disease, and woes like these, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Death laughed in his mad, wild glee; 
<BR>And Pestilence loosened his imps in the land, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And ships went down at sea. 
<P>But with all of the passion, and pain, and fear,--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With all of the long, sad hours,--
<BR>We have not forgotten to offer here 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our yearly tribute of flowers. 
<BR>I think the heart in a loyal breast 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Knows no such word as <i>forget</i>; 
<BR>And I think--nay, know--that in weal or in woe,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>We</i> shall remember our debt. 
<P>The debt of a nation redeemed from shame, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And a million of slaves set free, 
<BR>Of a spotless fame, and cherished name, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Honored on land and sea. 
<BR>Of the dear old flag kept out of the dust, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The flag of the brave and true,
<BR>And this is the debt we are owing yet 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the boys who wore the blue. 
<P>Thousands are sleeping in Southern graves,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no slab to tell us where; 
<BR>But the land where the sweet magnolia waves, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;God's hands keep fresh and fair. 
<BR>And the angels above; in pity and love, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch over the unknown mound,
<BR>Where some heart's joy, some mother's boy, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A nameless grave has found. 
<P>To a clear sweet song that is free and strong,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet sad with a minor strain, 
<BR>I liken the lives of the boys in blue,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who died ere they knew our gain; 
<BR>To a glad, glad song, that rings loud and bold,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a stirring major key, 
<BR>I liken in thought, the boys who fought,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And were crowned with victory. 
<P>To the hero who comes with the beating of drums,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We can give the laurels of fame; 
<BR>And with mirth, and music, and song and feast, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We can honor and praise his name; 
<BR>But we bring to the bed of the sainted dead, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Only these wreaths to-day; 
<BR>Yet they speak with their bloom and sweet perfume, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;More than our lips can say. 
<P>They speak of a love that can never die, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But strengthen and grow with time; 
<BR>Of lives that blossom again on high,--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a faith and hope sublime. 
<BR>They tell how a grateful nation's heart 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembers her tried and true, 
<BR>And how tears are shed for the honored dead, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the boys who wore the blue. 
<P>They speak of the higher and purer life 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Lord's dear angels know; 
<BR>Where nought can enter of pain or strife, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And tears can never flow. 
<BR>Sleep on brave boys your graves are as green 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As the thoughts we give to ye, 
<BR>And these blooms will say ye are shrined alway 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the halls of memory.

<P>If we sit down at set of sun, 
<BR>And count the things that we have done, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And counting, find 
<BR>One self-denying act, one word 
<BR>That eased the heart of him who heard,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One glance, most kind, 
<BR>That fell like sunshine where it went--
<BR>Then we may count that day well spent. 
<P>Or, on the other hand, if we,
<BR>In looking through the day, can see 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place or spot 
<BR>Where we an unkind act put down, 
<BR>Or where we smiled when wont to frown, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or crushed some thought 
<BR>That cumbered the heart--ground where it stood--
<BR>Then we may count that day as good. 
<P>But if, through all the life-long day, 
<BR>We've eased no heart by yea or nay; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If through it all 
<BR>We've done no thing that we can trace,
<BR>That brought the sunshine to a face--

<P>When the glad spring time walked over the border, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the brown honey bee crept from his cell; 
<BR>When the sun and the west wind put nature in order, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And decked her in robes that became her so well, 
<BR>Then did my torpid heart waken from slumber, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then did I first spring to life and to light. 
<BR>For what were the years passed without thee; they number 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Only as one long, dark, flavorless night. 
<P>In the flush of the spring time, I saw thee, and seeing, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Loved with the love that had waited for thee. 
<BR>A life that I never had known, sprang to being--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A life and a love that were heaven to me. 
<BR>There never before was such warmth in the summer, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There never before were such hues in the fall, 
<BR>Never such balm in the breath of that comer 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shrouds the dead seasons, and rules over all. 
<P>Love, I have drunk in the charm of thy presence,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The elixir that grants me perpetual life. 
<BR>My blood leaps, and bounds! I am thrilled with the essence, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And soar over trials, and troubles, and strife. 
<BR>We live, and we love! and what grief can alarm us; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Darling, my darling, the world is our own! 
<BR>Life never can rob us--death cannot disarm us 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this, our vast riches, our wealth, love, alone. 
<P>The summer is dead! Did'st know it, my darling? 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Did'st know that the winter walked over the earth? 
<BR>The gold-breasted thrush, and the quaker-crowned starling 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make glad other lands, with their innocent mirth. 
<BR>Ah no! for the summer of love in thy bosom, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make summer and sunlight, for thee, everywhere. 
<BR><i>I</i> should not have known: but I missed the bright blossom 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That all through the summer, I saw in thy hair.

<P>Oh, households wherein skeletons abide! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep the dark closet closed, nor think it wise 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To throw the door open for stranger eyes, 
<BR>To see the grinning, fleshless thing inside. 
<P>I hate that senseless, imbecile display 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of loathsome things, that calls the gaping crowd 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To gaze and comment. Let the screening shroud 
<BR>Cover the faces of the dead, I say.

<BR>For all the vulgar throng to gaze upon. 
<P>Oh, you whose souls are burdened cruelly, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shrink in anguish at the bitter smart

<P>Every morning, as I walk down 
<BR>From my dreary lodgings, toward the town, 
<BR>I see at the window near the street,
<BR>The face of a woman, fair, and sweet, 
<BR>With soft brown eyes, and chestnut hair,
<BR>And red lips, warm with the kiss left there. 
<BR>And she lingers as long as she can see 
<BR>The man who walks, just ahead of me. 
<P>At night, when I come from my office, down town, 
<BR>There stands the woman, with eyes of brown, 
<BR>Smiling out through the window-blind,
<BR>At the man who comes strolling on behind. 
<BR>This fellow and I resemble each other; 
<BR>At least, so I'm told, by one and another. 
<BR>(But I think I'm the handsomer, far, of the two.) 
<BR>I don't know him at all, save to &quot;how d'ye do,&quot; 
<BR>Or nod when I meet him. I think he's at work 
<BR>In a dry goods store, as a salaried clerk. 
<P>And I am a lawyer, of high renown; 
<BR>Have a snug bank account, and an office down town. 
<BR>Yet I feel for that fellow an envious spite: 
<BR>(It has no better name, so I speak it outright.) 
<BR>There were symptoms before: but it's grown, I believe, 
<BR>Alarmingly fast, since one cloudy eve, 
<BR>When passing the little house, close by the street, 
<BR>I heard the patter of two tiny feet,
<BR>And a figure in pink, fluttered down to the gate,
<BR>And a sweet voice exclaimed, &quot;Oh, Will, you are late 
<BR>And, darling, I've watched at the window until-- 
<BR>Sir, I beg pardon! I thought it was Will.&quot; 
<P>I passed on my way, with an odd little smart 
<BR>Beneath my vest pocket, in what's called the heart. 
<BR>For, as it happens, my name, too, is Will; 
<BR>And that voice crying &quot;darling&quot; sent such a strange thrill 
<BR>Throughout my whole being. &quot;How nice it would be,&quot; 
<BR>Thought I, &quot;if it were in reality me 
<BR>That she's watched and longed for, instead of that lout.&quot; 
<BR>(It was envy made me use that word, no doubt, 
<BR>For he's a fine fellow, and handsome, ahem!) 
<BR>But then it's absurd that this rare little gem 
<BR>Of a woman, should be on the look-out for him, 
<BR>Till she brings on a headache, and makes her eyes dim, 
<BR>While I go to lodgings, dull, dreary, and bare, 
<BR>With no one to welcome me, no one to care 
<BR>If I'm early, or late--no soft eyes of brown 
<BR>To watch when I go to, or come from, the town. 
<P>This bleak, wretched bachelor life, is about, 
<BR>If I may be allowed the expression--played out. 
<BR>Somewhere there must be, in this wide world, I think, 
<BR>Another fair woman, who dresses in pink. 
<BR>And I know of a cottage for sale just below, 
<BR>And it has a French window, in front, and--heigho 
<BR>I wonder how long, at the longest, 'twill be, 
<BR>Before coming home from the office I'll see 
<BR>A nice little woman there, watching for me.

<P>The harsh king, Winter, sat upon the hills,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And reigned, and ruled the earth right royally. 
<BR>He locked the rivers, lakes, and all the rills. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am no puny, maudlin king,&quot; quoth he, 
<BR>&quot;But a stern monarch, born to rule and reign,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will show my power to the end; 
<BR>The summer's flowery retinue I've slain,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And taken the bold, free North-Wind for my friend. 
<P>&quot;Spring, Summer, Autumn--feeble queens they were, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With their vast troops of flowers, birds, and bees,
<BR>And winds, that made the long, green grasses stir--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;They lost their own identity in these. 
<BR>I scorn them all! nay, I defy them all! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And none can wrest the sceptre from my hand. 
<BR>The trusty North-Wind answers to my call, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And breathes his icy breath upon the land.&quot; 
<P>The Siren, South-Wind, listening the while,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now floated airily across the lea. 
<BR>&quot;Oh, King!&quot; she said, with tender tone and smile, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I come to do all homage unto thee. 
<BR>In all the sunny region whence I came, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I find none like thee, King, so brave and grand. 
<BR>Thine is a well-deserved, unrivalled fame; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I kiss in awe, dear King, thy cold white hand.&quot; 
<P>Her words were pleasing, and most fair her face. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened rapt, to her soft-whispered praise. 
<BR>She nestled nearer, in her Siren grace; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dear King,&quot; she said, &quot;henceforth my voice shall raise 
<BR>But songs of thy unrivalled splendor! Lo! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;How white thy brow is! How thy garments shine--
<BR>I tremble 'neath thy beaming glance, for oh, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy wondrous beauty mak'st thee seem divine.&quot; 
<P>The vain king listened, in a trance of bliss,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To this most sweet sweet voiced Siren from the south. 
<BR>She nestled close, and pressed a lingering kiss 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the stern white pallor of his mouth. 
<BR>She hung upon his breast--she pressed his cheek--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was nothing loth to hold her there. 
<BR>While she such tender, loving words did speak 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And combed his white locks, with her fingers fair. 
<P>And so she bound him, in her Siren wiles, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And stole his strength with every glance she gave, 
<BR>And stabbed him through and through with tender smiles, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And with her loving words she dug his grave. 
<BR>And then she left him: old, and weak, and blind--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And unlocked all the rivers, lakes and rills,
<BR>While the Queen Spring, with her whole troop behind, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flowers, and birds, and bees, came over the hills.

<P>After the summer glory has departed, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sun slides low adown the skies,
<BR>After each snowy rose, and the red-hearted, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Droops in the chilling blast, and faints, and dies, 
<BR>When the brown bee no longer seeks the clover, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But flies away, and hides in his honeyed den. 
<BR>And from the bleak hills cutting winds blow over, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of keen darts--ah, will you love me then? 
<P>Or is it but the passion heat of Summer, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That you mistake for love within your heart? 
<BR>And will not Winter, that unwelcome comer, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With his cold, scornful sneers, make it depart? 
<BR>Have not the subtle odors of the flowers 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Drugged you, and made you drunk with rare perfumes? 
<BR>And when the winter crashes through the bowers, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will not your love fade, with the fading blooms? 
<P>If so, I will not listen to your wooing; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will turn from words and glances sweet.
<BR>Because I will not hear a drunkard's suing--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Drunken with rose-scents, and the summer heat. 
<BR>But if you woo me, in sound mind, and reason, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And can convince me fully it is so, 
<BR>And that your love will last through any season, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then, my answer will not <i>quite</i> be--No.

<P>Love, in the glow of the sunset, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been thinking of you. 
<BR>Thinking what you might have made me,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you had been constant and true. 
<BR>You know I built wonderful castles, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And you had a part in them all; 
<BR>But you cheated me, Love, you remember. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And down fell each beautiful wall. 
<P>Well, you see I lost faith in all women--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The very worst thing I could do. 
<BR>Thought they were all of one pattern, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And that was inconstant, untrue. 
<BR>I know it was but a mad fancy: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Know women are truer than men. 
<BR>But I wish I had found it out sooner, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or could live my life over again. 
<P>For you see I have wasted my manhood; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't really care to tell how. 
<BR>And if I could live it all over, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I could better it now. 
<BR>I would marry some nice little woman--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some other, if I couldn't get you. 
<BR>And I would be tender and faithful, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And she would be constant and true.

<P>Once there was a boat, locked fast to a shore, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But rust ate the chain, day by day, 
<BR>And the boat was loosened more and more, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;As the fastenings slipped away. 
<BR>Yet, any day, an outstretched hand,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Could have caught, and locked it again to land. 
<P>But never a hand was stretched to save, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the boat at last was free; 
<BR>And shot like an arrow over the wave, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And drifted out mid-sea. 
<BR>And never, oh never, across the main,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the boat to the shore be brought again. 
<P>So was my heart, love--linked to thine; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But neglect ate the chains away: 
<BR>Yet a tender word love, I opine, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Would have saved it, any day. 
<BR>Ay! a tender word, said first or last, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Would have mended the chain, and held it fast. 
<P>But the word was lacking: and so my heart,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Slipped from its chains, like the boat. 
<BR>And then as the last link fell apart,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;It sped o'er the waves--afloat. 
<BR>Nor pleading hands, nor words, you see, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Brings the boat to shore, or my heart to thee.

<P>Roses and Lilies, both are sweet; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lily and Rose, both are fair; 
<BR>But which to gather for mine alway,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Which to gather, and keep, and wear, 
<BR>That is the question that bothers me, 
<BR>For I cannot wear them both, you see. 
<P>Rose is the brightest and blithest of girls: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I could lay my heart at her tiny feet,
<BR>And gaze forever in those dark eyes,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And kiss forever those lips so sweet. 
<BR>And holding her soft, white, clinging hand, 
<BR>Dreamily float into Eden land. 
<P>And Lily--Lily, my ocean pearl,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So sweetly tender, so moonlight fair, 
<BR>I could float to heaven upon her smile, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And kiss forever her silken hair, 
<BR>That droppeth down, like a golden veil 
<BR>Over her cheek, and brow--snow pale. 
<P>Lilies and Roses--both are fair: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose, or Lily, which shall it be? 
<BR>I love them both with my heart of hearts,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But I cannot wed them both, you see. 
<BR>Dark-eyed Rose, my winsome girl--
<BR>Moon-faced Lily, my ocean pearl.

<P>'Tis said, when we shall go across the river, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose bridge is death, and gain the other side, 
<BR>There in that land, with God, the mighty Giver, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart shall evermore be satisfied. 
<P>And yet, sometimes I cannot help but wonder,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;How I can live in heaven without your love; 
<BR>How live, rejoicing, through all time, I ponder, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And not have you, even with God above. 
<P>We bear such things on earth, for we remember 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That life is but a little span, at best. 
<BR>Its passion summer, but precedes December, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the grave, we say, there will be rest. 
<P>But after death, time stretches with no limit: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your love, no time can ever bring to me. 
<BR>Is heaven so bright this shadow can not dim it? 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems so long--that strange Eternity. 
<P>How could my heart, and soul, change so completely 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That I should never think of this up there? 
<BR>But in the angel choruses join sweetly,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor ever feel this gnawing grief, and care. 
<P>How vast God's lore! how vain the skill of mortal! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not mean that we should understand, 
<BR>Until our feet had crossed the shining portal, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The things so deep, and fathomless, and grand. 
<P>And He has made a heaven--a place most holy,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For His redeemed to sometime enter in. 
<BR>And there is room for all the meek and lowly,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose faith, through sorrow hath washed out all sin. 
<P>And I believe, when we shall cross the river,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose bridge is death, and reach the other side,
<BR>There in that land, with God the gracious Giver, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts shall evermore be satisfied.

<BR>Rest on the hilltops--loiter near; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, O Time, in your flying. 
<BR>For never, in all the twice ten years, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;You have brought to build my twenty. 
<BR>Never was one so free from tears--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So overflowing with plenty. 
<P>Filled to the brim with the purest draughts,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That I sip in fearless pleasure;

<BR>My brightest dreams, and my fondest hopes,

<BR>And my path is strewn with the glories of June,

<BR>Contentment hedged me all round about,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love built his blazing fire; 
<BR>And Happiness poured his treasures out,

<P>I have walked breast high in a sea of bliss: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have loved my God, and my brother. 
<BR>There never before was a year like this--

<P>My life has been a summer day complete, 
<BR>Teeming with pleasures, tender, pure, and sweet. 
<BR>But tiny clouds have ever dimmed the sky, 
<BR>And they have quickly passed, and floated by. 
<P>Oh, seldom in this thorny world of ours, 
<BR>Is mortal's pathway so bestrewn with flowers. 
<BR>Fragrant and fair, they ever blow and bloom,
<BR>Untouched by chilling frosts, and wintry gloom. 
<BR>And I thank God, for all his tenderness,
<BR>And from my very soul adore, and bless 
<BR>Him who has cast my lines in pleasant ways,
<BR>And crowned with joy and happiness my days. 
<P>But sometimes, though the sun shines clear and bright, 
<BR>And all the world seems full of joy and light, 
<BR>A nameless shadow, none but I can see, 
<BR>Falls on my heart, hushing its melody. 
<BR>A nameless, voiceless shadow; but I know 
<BR>It tells of future agony and woe. 
<BR>Some mighty sorrow, vague and undefined,
<BR>But dark, and awful, waits for me, behind 
<BR>That shadowy cloud. Something of woe and tears--

<P>It floats away, and I rejoice again, 
<BR>With all my warm young heart untouched by pain. 
<BR>But ever and anon I see it loom,

<P>In the warm yellow smile of the morning,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stride down to the fields of grain; 
<BR>And she counts the over and over

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last red rays of the sun, 
<BR>She will sit at the threshold waiting, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her withered face lights with joy: 
<BR>&quot;Come, Johnnie,&quot; she says, as they pass her, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come in to the house, my boy.&quot; 
<P>Five summers ago, her Johnnie 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went out in the smile o' the morn,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Striding down through the corn: 
<BR>He towered above the binders 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on either side, 
<BR>And the mother's heart within her 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swelled with exultant pride. 
<P>For he was the light of the household; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brown eyes were wells of truth, 
<BR>And his face was the face of the morning, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lit with its pure, fresh youth; 
<BR>And his song rang out from the hill-tops, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the mellow blast of a horn,
<BR>As he strode o'er the fresh shorn meadows, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down through the rows of corn. 
<P>But hushed were the voices of singing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hushed by the presence of death, 
<BR>As back to the cottage they bore him--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the noontide's scorching breath. 
<BR>For the heat of the sun had slain him,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had smitten the heart in his breast,
<BR>And he who had towered above them

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the summers ebb and flow,

<BR>Never up from the meadows,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never back from the corn.

<BR>She is blest in her strange delusion,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For she knoweth no pain, no fear: 
<BR>And always she counts the binders

<P>When on the crowded thoroughfare, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst the motley throng I stray. 
<BR>In all the stranger faces there, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I meet and pass from day to day. 
<BR>Whether the face be young, or old,

<BR>On every brow I trace some line

<P>Though a proud beauty rustles by, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With haughty mien, I smile and say, 
<BR>&quot;You have a heart-ache--so have I: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We both are hiding it to-day. 
<BR>Though you are rich, I am poor,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We both have entered sorrow's door; 
<BR>Grief comes alike to you and me, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are of one family.&quot; 
<P>The richest nabob that I meet, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The poorest delver that I see,
<BR>Youth and old age upon the street,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are one and all the same to me. 
<BR>No heart that beats, but has its grief; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor wealth, nor youth, gives full relief; 
<BR>And through the tears that sometimes fall 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I claim relationship to all. 
<P>So poor, and rich, and high, and low, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I meet upon this common plain. 
<BR>Though far and wide our paths may lie,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We entertain the same guest--Pain. 
<BR>The subtle threads of this strange cord,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw me to mankind, and the Lord, 
<BR>And through the sorrows heaven sends, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hold all men to be my friends.

<BR>She was so fair--like the beautiful lily--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair, oh too fair to be hidden away. 
<BR>And the grave is so dark, and so damp, and so chilly,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And she--oh my love!--will be buried to-day.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whiter the face, in this desolate room. 
<BR>Low in the valley lurk darkness and shadow--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Low lies my heart, in its sorrow and gloom. 
<BR>How the spades scrape, on the sods they are breaking, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking, and cutting the snowdrifts away. 
<BR>How the men bend to the grave they are making. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where she--oh my love!--will be buried to-day.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And chill her through all her long slumber, I know. 
<BR>Rich are her robes! but the merciless Winter 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will beat on her breast, with its tempests of snow. 
<BR>Oh, she was guarded, and shielded from sorrow--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept from the shadows, and darkness, alway. 
<BR>But she will lie, as the beggar to-morrow--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My love--oh my love!--that is buried to-day.

<P>Under the moon two lovers walked--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver moon--the round, full moon;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of youth, and love, and June.

<P>Under the moon they walked again--

<BR>And scarcely a word was said by the twain. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ah moon, you set too soon.) 
<BR>For love, in one o' the hearts, like the rim

<P>Under the skies a maiden stood--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold night skies--the moonless skies:

<BR>Though the words breathe only of mirth, and bloom,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the strains are the gladdest and lightest, 
<BR>Remember that after a night of gloom,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The rays of the sun are brightest. 
<P>The rain must fall, ere the spring-time grass

<BR>Through the pangs of travail, a soul must pass,

<P>Into the mellow light of the cloudless autumn day, 
<BR>Somehow, the vision slips, of a landscape, far away,
<BR>Wherever I turn my eyes, it hovers before them still, 
<BR>The little, vine-wreathed cot, on the southerly slope of the hill, 
<P>The pasture at the left, the ducks a-swim in the pond, 
<BR>And the straight, green rows of corn, with the wheat fields just beyond, 
<BR>The sloping lawn on the right, that is always seeming to say 
<BR>To the lake that lies below, &quot;I will meet you just half way.&quot; 
<P>And over and over the cot, from th' ground to th' mossy eaves, 
<BR>Cling, and twine, and clamber the vines, with their dark, green leaves; 
<BR>The little mimic garden, with its simple flowers a-blow, 
<BR>Larkspur, bleeding hearts, and the clumps of phlox, like snow; 
<P>Petunias, red and white, like drooping and fragile maids, 
<BR>Rose trees hanging down, with roses of many shades, 
<BR>Marigolds, bachelor-buttons, with clusters of evergreen, 
<BR>On the two trim rows of beds, with the narrow path between, 
<P>And the setting rays of the sun, lending it all a flush, 
<BR>That is given to sunset scenes, by the heavenly Artist's brush. 
<BR>It is thus it rises to-day, and hovers before my eyes; 
<BR>I have seen it softly lit, with the mornings' sweet surprise--
<P>I have seen it when the dew glistened upon the grass--
<BR>In the hush of the summer noon, when the calm lake lay like glass--
<BR>In the ghostly rays o' the moon--in the quiet of the night--
<BR>But never half so fair as under that sunset light. 
<P>Ah! foolish, and weak old heart, must you live it over again? 
<BR>Why reopen the book, whose final page was Pain! 
<BR>But the picture rises before me, rises, and hovers there, 
<BR>And the glory of the sunset falls on the maiden's hair; 
<P>The maid, who stood in that garden ten long summers ago, 
<BR>Stood by the &quot;bleeding hearts,&quot; and the clusters of phlox, like snow. 
<BR>Ah! musty and dusty old heart, you were younger and lighter then! 
<BR>Yet not young, for now you have beat, two score years and ten;
<BR> 
<BR>But that one summer holds the essence of all my life, 
<BR>The forty years before were records of toil and strife, 
<BR>And I opened the book again, when my holiday was o'er, 
<BR>And began at the page I left, and plodded on as before. 
<P>Weary of law, of work, of the dust, and heat of th' town, 
<BR>Ill, in body and mind, my heart went longing down 
<BR>To the cool, green country meadows; and I followed it one day,
<BR>And there in the vine-wreathed cot, let the summer slip away; 
<P>Ay! and I let the heart I had guarded forty years--
<BR>The heart that had never been stirred by love's wild hopes and fears--
<BR>I let it slip away to the maid with amber eyes, 
<BR>With tresses dusky brown, and cheeks like th' sunset skies. 
<P>Ah! secret I tried to keep, ah! love I strove to hide! 
<BR>But in the July twilight, I lingered at her side,
<BR>And, leaning by the rose tree, her tresses swept my cheek! 
<BR>&quot;Ah! sweet,&quot; I cried in a tremor, &quot;I love you--let me speak!&quot; 
<P>And then, somehow the love I had thought to guard untold 
<BR>Broke loose from the fetters of silence, and gathered strength, and rolled 
<BR>Forth in a torrent of words; and I knelt at the maiden's feet, 
<BR>Crying, &quot;Grant me a token, as yea or nay, my sweet.&quot; 
<P>And then, with a shy, sweet smile, she gave me her finger-tips, 
<BR>And, bolder grown, I said, as I raised them to my lips, 
<BR>&quot;'Twere a lesser love than mine, that were wholly satisfied,
<BR>With a touch of your fingertips, and farther than that denied.&quot; 
<P>The curtains of her eyes dropped low, and I drew her close, 
<BR>And over and over again kissed the sweet face like a rose. 
<BR>I said, &quot;I have pleaded a case, and won it; do you see? 
<BR>And now I take my pay! for a lawyer must have his fee.&quot; 
<P>Ah! summer over and gone, into the echoless past! 
<BR>Oh! August afternoons, that drifted by too fast! 
<BR>Oh! rows on the quiet lake, in the blissful moonlit eves, 
<BR>When the harvesters sang their song, carrying home the sheaves. 
<P>I can hear it even now, the voices, strong and sweet, 
<BR>Over the noise, and rattle, and roar of the busy street, 
<BR>I can see the face of Mable, full lipped, ripe, and fair,
<BR>With the amber tints in her eyes, and the dusky shades on her hair. 
<P>Into my life's September, came the beauty I missed in June, 
<BR>The glory lost in the morning, came in the afternoon. 
<BR>The dream that belongs to youth, golden--complete--sublime, 
<BR>I dreamed not, in the spring, but in the autumn time. 
<P>Ah! and the young heart wakes from the dream of love, and then, 
<BR>Suffers a little while, and dreams it over again. 
<BR>But never a second draught of the wine of love for me, 
<BR>I drank it all at the first, and shattered the cup, you see. 
<P>I woke from the golden dream when I saw <i>her</i> on the breast 
<BR>Of a fair-faced, beardless youth--when I saw his red lips pressed 
<BR>Over and over again to the mouth, like a rose half blown, 
<BR>And I heard her whispered words--&quot;My only love, my own.&quot; 
<P>Hush! censure them not! His heart she toyed with even as mine. 
<BR>He suffered keenly, I think, then knelt at another's shrine. 
<BR>And she--speak softly of her--she died: she is only dust; 
<BR>Died repentant--forgiven--and entered Heaven--I trust. 
<P>And I--well my years drift on, as my two-score drifted away, 
<BR>Only at times, this memory comes, as it came to-day, 
<BR>Thrilling me through and through--and I live it all once more, 
<BR>Though I shut the past away, and have striven to lock the door. 
<P>Have I lost all faith in woman? Nay, surely not: should we 
<BR>Say that every heart is false because <i>one</i> proves to be! 
<BR>Because I find a worm in the petals of a rose, 
<BR>Shall I say that worms are coiled in every flower that blows? 
<P>Nay, there are constant woman, and women as sweet and fair 
<BR>As she with the amber eyes, and the shadows on her hair. 
<BR>But I found the wine of love so late, that when I quaffed 
<BR>I held none in reserve, but drank it all at a draught. 
<P>The future? I do not dread: it is neither dark nor bright. 
<BR>I have had my day of joy--I have had my sorrow's night. 
<BR>God helped me through the last--I do not know just how,
<BR>But He answered when I called Him, and why should I doubt him now? 
<P>Nor mortal eye can see, nor mortal heart conceive, 
<BR>What He holdeth in His kingdom for the faithful that believe. 
<BR>But I sometimes think the dream that was broken here for me, 
<BR>I shall finish and complete by the shining Jasper sea.

<P>Ah, poet! finish your last light strain: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, maid! shall we give you praise, or blame? 
<BR>You are wringing a heart, with bitter pain, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet helping to laurel a brow with fame. 
<P>For out of the depths of a master woe,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the valley of dark despair, 
<BR>The soul of a singer must grope, and go,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere he wear the purple true poets wear.

<BR>The day grows dim, and the shadows grim, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are gathering on apace. 
<BR>I am glad that the night is coming: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am weary, and want to rest. 
<BR>What! do you weep, that I fall asleep 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaning upon your breast? 
<P>&quot;Oh, Sister, I am <i>so</i> tired: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;How tired you can not know. 
<BR>And a jarring pain, in my weary brain, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beats like a cruel blow. 
<BR>I think it will all have vanished,

<P>&quot;Such a beautiful dream, my sister, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I dreamed while I slept last night. 
<BR>I thought he was true: and he came with you,

<BR>And he said--. But I am so weary,

<P>Three days agone, and she was here: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her light step on the stair was springing. 
<BR>Her sweet voice fell upon my ear; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;(She mocked the thrushes in her singing.) 
<BR>The billows of her long, bright hair 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell round her, in a golden splendor. 
<BR>Her face was young and fresh and fair; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes were innocent and tender. 
<P>Her presence filled the house: each room 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed of her pure and sweet existence. 
<BR>She was like some rare plant in bloom,

<BR>Here was her ribbon--there her book, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond, her wreath, or faded flower. 
<BR>A step, a voice, a laugh, a look, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Told of her presence, hour by hour. 
<P>&quot;How strange is life!&quot; I said, &quot;From naught 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;God fashioned out this glowing creature. 
<BR>Endowed with motion, feeling thought--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect in symmetry, and feature. 
<BR>Sweeter than any opening rose, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;All grace and beauty hangs about her. 
<BR>Though every flower were left that blows, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth would be bare and bleak, without her.&quot; 
<P>Three days agone! ay! life is strange, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But death is stranger, vaster, deeper. 
<BR>It brings us tears, and gloom, and change. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>She</i> was God's sheaf, and Death His reaper. 
<BR>Three days! and now no voice is heard--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No light step on the stair is bounding. 
<BR>In vain the tuneful-throated bird 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Listens to hear her answer sounding. 
<P>I cannot find her, anywhere! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;How vast and strange the mystic power, 
<BR>That leaves but one soft strand of hair, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all that golden, shining shower. 
<BR>In door, and out, in every place, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I search and seek; oh, vain endeavor! 
<BR>The voice, the laugh, the form, the face, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have vanished from the earth forever. 
<P>A spot of ground, a fresh-turned sod, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hides what was beautiful and mortal. 
<BR>Her spirit (fairer still) to God, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And life eternal, crossed the portal.

<P>Through all the weary, hot midsummer time, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart has struggled with its awful grief. 
<BR>And I have waited for these autumn days, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking the cooling winds would bring relief. 
<BR>For I remembered how I loved them once, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When all my life was full of melody. 
<BR>And I have looked and longed for their return, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor thought but they would seem the same, to me. 
<P>The fiery summer burned itself away, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the hills, the golden autumn time 
<BR>Looks down and smiles. The fields are tinged with brown--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds are talking of another clime. 
<BR>The forest trees are dyed in gorgeous hues, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And weary ones have sought an earthy tomb. 
<BR>But still the pain tugs fiercely at my heart--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And still my life is wrapped in awful gloom. 
<P>The winds I thought would cool my fevered brow, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are bleak, and dreary; and they bear no balm. 
<BR>The sounds I thought would soothe my throbbing brain, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are grating discords; and they cannot calm 
<BR>This inward tempest. Still, it rages on. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul is tossed upon a troubled sea, 
<BR>I find no pleasure in the olden joys--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The autumn is not as it used to be. 
<P>I hear the children shouting at their play! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Their hearts are happy, and they know not pain. 
<BR>To them the day brings sunlight, and no shade. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I would not be a child again. 
<BR>For surely as the night succeeds the day. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So surely will their mirth turn into tears. 
<BR>And I would not return to happy hours, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;If I must live again these weary years. 
<P>I would walk on, and leave it all behind: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;will walk on; and when my feet grow sore, 
<BR>The boatman waits--his sails are all unfurled--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;He waits to row me to a fairer shore. 
<BR>My tired limbs shall rest on beds of down, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My tears shall all be wiped by Jesus' hand; 
<BR>My soul shall know the peace it long hath sought--

<P>Across the sodden field we gaze,

<BR>Oh, lavish autumn! fair, we know, 
<BR>And yet we cannot deem her so. 
<P>The blossoms had their little day; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The grasses, and the green-hung trees. 
<BR>They lived, grew old, and passed away. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, not satisfied with these,
<BR>The cruel autumn could not pass 
<BR>Without this last fell stroke: alas! 
<P>&quot;Alas,&quot; we cry, because God's ways 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem so at variance with our own, 
<BR>And grieving through the nights and days, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;We see not that His love was shown 
<BR>In gathering to the &quot;Harvest Home,&quot;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So, they groaned, till night came on. 
<BR>And the hoar-frost lurked, and listened, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the wailing, sad refrain. 
<BR>And he whispered, &quot;Wait--be patient--

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No ma'am, not any for me. 
<BR>I know I'd be cross and unhappy, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With children to tease, and annoy. 
<BR>A joy, you say, to be mother, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I will be spared that joy.&quot; 
<P>Across the hall in their bedroom 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A hale old couple sat, 
<BR>Minnie's grandfather and mother,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a good night chat. 
<BR>&quot;So, the last of the children is going,&quot; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandmother said, and sighed, 
<BR>&quot;Minnie, (we named her Mary,) 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow will be a bride. 
<P>&quot;It will be a great occasion,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;All glitter and glow and shine, 
<BR>A nineteenth century wedding, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much like yours, and mine. 
<BR>A few good friends were with us, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were married, John, 
<BR>They came to see us united--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to see what the bride had on. 
<P>&quot;I wore a snowy muslin, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And a white rose in my hair, 
<BR>No silks nor gems, nor diadems--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet you thought me fair. 
<BR>We stood in the broad cool kitchen,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the white and sanded floor, 
<BR>And a breeze from the odorous orchard, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked in at the open door. 
<P>&quot;The minister read the service 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That made us one for life, 
<BR>And I was no longer a maiden 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;But a loved and cherished wife. 
<BR>You took me home on the morrow! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Six miles, in a one-horse chaise; 
<BR>Folks didn't race over the country 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;'Touring' in those old days.
<P>&quot;Our house was a tiny cabin 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That would just hold two, you said, 
<BR>But ere a year, you found, my dear 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;There was room for three, instead. 
<BR>Ah me! that wonderful baby! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas a moment of perfect bliss 
<BR>When I held up the pink faced darling 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For his father's tender kiss. 
<P>&quot;Then came a dear little daughter! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And then more boys and girls 
<BR>Till you built on a wing to the cabin 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To cover their sunny curls. 
<BR>There was never a happier woman 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;In all of the land I know, 
<BR>Singing away at my labor--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching the children grow. 
<P>&quot;I had my beaux and lovers, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a girl; but when 
<BR>I became your bride I put aside 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;All thoughts of other men. 
<BR>Lover, and king, and husband,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And friend, I found in you, 
<BR>And you repaid my devotion, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;By being kind, and true. 
<P>&quot;Ah well! the world keeps changing 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And weddings have changed with the rest, 
<BR>People go only to comment 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And see how the bride is drest. 
<BR>Girls wed houses and titles 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of men as of old, 
<BR>And babies are out of the fashion 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that glitters is gold. 
<P>&quot;Perhaps these times are better, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I cannot think them so, 
<BR>But I am a poor old woman. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And not supposed to know.&quot; 
<BR>And grandmother finished her musings 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With a meaning shake of the head 
<BR>Over nineteenth century folly. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And sighed, and went to bed.

<P>Could I but measure my strength, by my love,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Were I as strong, as my heart's love is true, 
<BR>I would pull down the stars, from the heavens above, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And weave them all into a garland for you. 
<BR>And brighter, and better, your jewels should be 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Than any proud queen's, that e'r dwelt o'er the sea. 
<BR>Ay! richer and rarer, your gems, love, should be 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Than any rare jewels that come from the sea. 
<P>I would gather the beautiful, delicate green 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the dress of the spring--with the heaven's soft blue,
<BR>And never from east land, to west land were seen 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Such wonderful robes, as I'd fashion for you. 
<BR>And I'd snatch the bright rays of the sun in my hand 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And braid you a girdle, love, strand over strand. 
<BR>Ay! one by one, catch the bright rays in my hand 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And braid them, and twine them, all strand over strand. 
<P>I would gather the amber, the red and gold dyes, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;That glimmer and glow, in the autumn sunset,
<BR>And weave you a mantle; and pull from the skies 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainbow to trim it. Ah Love! never yet 
<BR>Was any proud princess, from east to the west 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So peerlessly jeweled--so royally drest. 
<BR>Never daughter of princes, in east land or west, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;So decked in rare jewels, so gorgeously drest. 
<P>And I'd make you a vail, from the rare golden haze,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Indian Summer spreads over the lea. 
<BR>And trim it with dew! Queens should envy and praise 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your matchless apparel, ah darling, but see--
<BR>My strength is unequal to what I would do! 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only this little low cottage, for you. 
<BR>Nay! I can not accomplish the thing I would do, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I've only this cot and a warm heart for you. 
<P class="centered">1870
<H3><I><A id="ForgetMe">YOU WILL FORGET ME</A></I></H3>
<P>You will forget me: the years are so tender--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;They bind up the wounds which we think are so deep; 
<BR>This dream of our youth will fade out as the splendor 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fades from the sky, when the sun sinks to sleep: 
<BR>The clouds of forgetfulness, over and over, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will banish the last rosy colors away; 
<BR>And th' fingers of Time will weave garlands to cover 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The scar which you think is a life-mark to-day. 
<P>You will forget me:--will thank me for saying 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The words which you think are so pointed with pain, 
<BR>Time loves a new lay; and the dirge he is playing 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will change for you soon to a livelier strain. 
<BR>I shall pass from your life, I shall pass out forever, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hours we have spent, will be sunk in the past. 
<BR>Youth buries its dead: grief kills seldom, or never, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And forgetfulness covers all sorrows at last. 
<P>You will forget me; the one thing you covet 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, above all things will soon seem no prize: 
<BR>And the heart which is not in your keeping, to prove it 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;True or untrue, will lose worth in your eyes. 
<BR>The one drop to-day, which you deem only wanting 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;To make life a joy, will be lost in Time's stream; 
<BR>You will forget; and the ghost that is haunting 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The aisles of your heart will pass out with the dream.
